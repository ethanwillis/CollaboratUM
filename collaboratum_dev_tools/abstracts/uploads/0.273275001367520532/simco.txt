AB The American shad Alosa supidissima is currently in emerging aquaculture
   species in China, and establishing conditions required for optimal
   growth will play a key role in future development of American shad
   Culture. We evaluated the effects of increasing salinity concentrations
   on survival, growth. and feed utilization of American shad in two
   separate 30-d experiments. In experiment 1, 25-d-old. premetamorphic
   fish (mean weight +/- SD = 0.07 +/- 0.04 g) were exposed to 0, 10, 20,
   and 30-ppt salinity (26-29 degrees C). In experiment 2, 80-d-old.
   postmetamorphic fish (1.46 +/- 0.52 g) were exposed to 0, 5, 10, 20, and
   30-ppt salinity (21-26 degrees C). Mortality was markedly higher at
   salinities of 20 ppt (52% and 74%, respectively. for pre- and
   postmetarnorphic fish) and 30 ppt (100% and 90%, respectively) than at 0
   and 5 ppt (< 1%). Specific growth rate (SGR) and feed conversion
   efficiency (FCE) were highest at 0-ppt salinity for premetamorphic fish
   (SGR = 8.81% per day; FCE = 1.12) and in 5-ppt salinity for
   postmetamorphic fish (SGR = 4.59% per day: FCE = 0.87). The SGR and FCE
   were lowest at 30-ppt salinity, and a significant negative relationship
   was demonstrated between salinity and SGR and between salinity and FCE.
   In both experiments. SGR and FCE were positively correlated. Our
   observations demonstrate that culture of young American shad may be
   possible all salinities up to 10 ppt, but 0-5-ppt salinity produced the
   best growth.

   (Ictaturus punctatus) NWAC 102 and 103 strains, blue catfish (Ictalurus
   furcatus) D+B and Rio Grande strains, hybrid catfish (channel catfish
   female NWAC 103 x blue catfish male D+B) sera, and purified by affinity
   chromatography from channel catfish Norris strain serum. Reduction of
   purified channel catfish MBL with 2-ME yielded a single band of 62 kDa
   by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using guinea pig anti-MBL IgG as
   primary antibody. Channel catfish NWAC 102 strain, channel catfish NWAC
   103 strain and hybrid catfish sera had molecular masses of 63 kDa for
   MBL. Blue catfish (D+B strain) serum MBL had a molecular mass of 66 kDa.
   Rio Grande blue catfish serum MBL had a molecular mass of 65 kDa. Amino
   acid composition analysis (mol%) of the affinity-purified channel
   catfish MBL found a high content of serine present. Functional binding
   studies of channel catfish and blue catfish MBLs binding to Edwardsiella
   ictaluri were done using a dot-immunoblot ELISA method. A dot-immunoblot
   ELISA binding assay was done to compare nine different strains and
   species of channel catfish and blue catfish for their levels of serum
   MBL. Blue catfish had higher levels of MBL than did the various strains
   of channel catfish tested. MBL could be used as a genetic marker for
   selection of disease resistance in the different strains of catfish used
   in aquaculture. This study describes the presence of serum MBL in
   catfish and evidence for a C-type lectin complement pathway of innate
   immunity. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus have an XX female-XY male genotypic
   system of Sex determination, and male channel catfish grow faster than
   females. Through selective breeding and appropriately timed hormone
   administration, we have produced phenotypic male channel catfish with a
   YY sex genotype and female channel catfish with an XY or YY sex
   genotype. In this study, we evaluated the relative role of sex genotype
   and sex phenotype in regulating sexually dimorphic growth in this
   important aquaculture species. Ten families of genotypic XY male fish
   were produced by matings of normal XX female fish with YY male fish, and
   females were produced by hormonal feminization of a subsample from each
   family. The growth rate and body composition of sibling males and
   females in ponds where the sexes were maintained together were compared
   with those in ponds where the sexes were maintained separately.
   Generally, phenotypic males had higher body weight (15.25% and 11.36%
   when the sexes were together or separated, respectively), standard
   length (3.28% and 2.24%, respectively), and condition factor (2.94 and
   2.65, respectively), while phenotypic females had higher liposomatic
   index (7.11% and 13.69%, respectively) and dress-out percentage (0.91%
   and 1.06%, respectively). Statistical differences between the phenotypic
   sexes were not as consistent as observed in previous studies with normal
   males and females because growth and body composition differences were
   enhanced when the sexes were maintained together; however, monosex
   culture restrained these differences. These results demonstrate that sex
   genotype and sex phenotype both contribute to the male growth advantage
   in channel catfish and provide further evidence that monosex male
   culture would produce an economic gain of about 5% for the industry
   compared with conventional mixed-sex culture.

AB American shad Alosa sapidissima were introduced into China for
   aquaculture several years ago. Growth and reproduction of American shad
   maintained exclusively in artificial freshwater culture system were
   reported in this study. Size of cultured population in this experiment
   was similar to that of the wild population from the coastal North
   Carolina, and somewhat higher than that of the wild population from the
   Delaware River near Lambertville, USA. Two-year-old broodfish spawned
   naturally in ponds, or were induced to spawn with injections of Ovaprim.
   Mean fertilization, hatching and seventeen day survival rates of larvae
   were about 15%, 75% and 54% respectively. These results indicate
   American shad can be successfully established in artificial freshwater
   culture system when its favorable living environments are provided.
   Based on these results and other biological characteristics, it can be
   concluded that American shad may become a potential invader to the
   aquatic ecosystem in China when escaping from farms [ Acta Zoologica
   Sinica 53 (4) : 625 - 629, 2007].

AB Most channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus do not spawn until age 3, which
   makes the process of genetic selection for desired characteristics time
   consuming. A simple method for identifying earlier-maturing fish would
   speed up the selection process. Two- and three-year-old females (U.S.
   Department of Agriculture [USDA]-103 strain) were used to correlate body
   weight and plasma sex hormone concentrations with gonadal development.
   We also examined the potential of reducing the time to maturation with
   exogenous estrogen. The USDA-103 females are known to spawn at age 2 in
   a higher percentage than other strains. The body weight of 2-year-old
   USDA-103 females ranged from 436 to 884 g, and the gonadosomatic index
   (GSI) ranged from 0.34% to 6.64%. A population of 2-year-old USDA-103
   fish that had been hormonally sex-reversed to females (SR103) weighed
   from 400 to 1,400 g and had GSIs ranging from 1% to 10%. Three-year-old
   SR103 females weighed from 1,300 to 2,800 g and had GSIs ranging from 2%
   to 14%. Only about 10% of the 2-year-old SR103 females had GSI values
   similar to the expected level for fish ready to spawn. Plasma estrogen
   concentration was a more reliable predictor of GSI than was body weight.
   Body size was significantly correlated with GSI in 2-year-old USDA-103
   and SR103 females but not in 3-year-old SR103 fish; plasma estrogen was
   highly correlated with GSI in fish of both ages. Plasma estrogen,
   testosterone, and GSI were markedly lower in 2-year-old fish than in
   3-year-old fish in both populations of USDA females. Oral administration
   of estrogen to 2-year-old USDA-103 females increased plasma estrogen but
   did not increase ovarian development.

AB Initial and confinement-induced changes of plasma cortisol were measured
   in channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus acclimated to upper and lower
   constant temperatures for each season, a spring/fall diurnal pattern
   between 15 and 26 C, and a summer diurnal pattern between 24 and 35 C.
   In diurnal treatments, temperature changes were achieved in 10 h and
   held constant for 2 h before reversing the temperature. Fish held in the
   spring/fall pattern or at a constant temperature of 15 or 26 C revealed
   no plasma cortisol concentration differences due to acclimation
   temperature, but hormone concentrations in all groups increased by about
   4.5 fold following a 2-h confinement. Fish held on a summer pattern had
   differences in both the initial cortisol samples and those measured
   after confinement. Acclimation to a constant 35 C resulted in
   significantly higher initial cortisol concentrations, but these levels
   did not increase following confinement. The inability of the fish held
   at 35 C to respond to the confinement was thought to be due to the
   constant thermal stress, resulting in an inadequate interrenal reserve.
   Physiological consequences due to the diurnal physiochemical cycling in
   ponds needs further attention.

   were fed diets with reduced levels of supplemental vitamin C, niacin,
   riboflavin, pantothenic acid, pyridoxine or thiamine, or with reduced
   amounts of the total vitamin supplement typically added to catfish feed.
   Fish were confined for 6 h and blood samples taken at 0, 1 and 6 h of
   confinement and 12 h after release. Plasma chloride and osmotic pressure
   were consistently stable throughout the experiment and were not
   influenced by the diet or the stress imposed. Cortisol concentrations
   were elevated at 1 and 6 h of confinement but recovered to
   preconfinement concentrations 12 h after release. The cortisol response
   varied in some of the groups; however, no consistent effects due to the
   vitamin concentrations were observed. The lack of supplemental vitamins
   in the food did not impair the ability of the fish to mount or maintain
   cortisol secretion. The feed ingredients may contain enough vitamins to
   support cortisol synthesis or the fish may be acquiring sufficient
   additional vitamins from the pond environment or from intestinal
   bacteria.

AB Channel catfish have an XX female-XY male sex determination system.
   Although genetic males of this species are readily feminized with
   exogenous steroid, the pattern of gonadal sex differentiation and the
   effect of temperature on genetic sex determination are unknown. To
   document the pattern of gonadal sex differentiation, catfish from a
   mixed-sex progeny (XX female-XY male cross), known XY males (XX
   female-YY male cross), and steroid sex-reversed (XY) females were reared
   at 28 degrees C and collected for histological analysis from Day 7 to
   Day 90 postfertilization. No signs of gonadal sex differentiation were
   detected from Day 7 to Day 16. On Day 19, about half the fish from the
   mixed-sex population as well as the sex-reversed females had gonads with
   proximal and distal tissue outgrowths. These outgrowths eventually fused
   to form an ovarian cavity. Germ cell meiosis in these gonads was first
   detected on Day 22 and growing ovarian follicles were seen at later
   stages. Thus, ovarian differentiation began about Day 19. Although
   presumptive testes lose their sensitivity to feminizing steroids about
   Day 19, the gonads of known males and of putative males from the
   mixed-sex population showed no clear signs of sex differentiation up to
   Day 90. Thus, the prolonged temporal dissociation between testicular
   commitment and differentiation indicates that these two events may be
   mediated by separate stimuli. To determine the effects of temperature on
   sex determination, fish of a mixed-sex population were reared at 27
   degrees C until Day 10; at 20 degrees, 27 degrees, or 34 degrees C from
   Day 10 to Day 24; and then at 27 degrees C until Day 102 when sex ratios
   and gonadal histology were determined. The sex ratio was significantly
   skewed toward females in fish treated at 34 degrees C (1 male:1.68
   female; P < 0.01) but no effects were seen at 20 degrees or 27 degrees
   C. This observation suggests that genetic and temperature-dependent
   mechanisms of sex determination are both functional in channel catfish
   and that this phenomenon is more widespread in fishes than previously
   believed. The testes of the Day 102 males examined had developed
   positive histological signs of sex differentiation, suggesting that
   testicular formation in channel catfish normally starts between Day 90
   and 102. (C) 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.*

AB Allozyme expression of 14 loci was studied in diploid channel catfish
   Ictalurus punctatus, blue catfish I. furcatus, and diploid and triploid
   hybrid catfish (channel catfish X blue catfish). This allowed
   appropriate interpretation of allozyme expression and estimates of
   gene-centromere distances in triploid hybrid catfish and contributed to
   genetic characterization of the commercially important ictalurid
   catfishes. Five polymorphic loci in the parental female channel catfish
   were used to confirm the retention of an extra diagnostic maternal
   allele in triploid offspring. Fidelity of gene dosage and allozyme
   expression of three parental alleles were found at 13 of 14 loci of
   triploid progeny; however, expression of phosphoglucomutase (PGM) in 174
   and 197 triploid hybrids was similar to that of diploid hybrids.
   Electrophoretic variation for PGM was observed when different buffers
   were used, indicating nongenetic alteration of expression. Two
   polymorphic loci in triploid hybrid catfish provided new gene-centromere
   distances of 14 centimorgans (cM) for aspartate aminotransferase (mAAT*)
   and 45 cM for glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI-A*). No differences
   were found in recombination rates of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDHP*)

AB Growth of fish has been associated with the phenotypes of specific
   biochemical genetic loci, although the correlation of growth with
   sex-specific loci has not been routinely studied, In a previous study in
   channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), glucose phosphate isomerase-B
   (GPI-B) was linked with the sex-determining gene (SDG) with a
   recombination frequency of 15.2%. Growth performance related to sex and
   GPI-B phenotypes was investigated in five experimental matings of
   channel catfish, The association of sex and GPI-B with growth,
   differences in growth among GPI-B phenotypes, and the degree of linkage
   with growth between sex and GPI-B were evaluated by ANOVA followed by
   Duncan's Multiple Range Test (P < 0.05). Significant growth differences
   were found between males and females in all families examined; males
   outweighed females by 36%, confirming observations from earlier studies.
   The phenotypes of GPI-B were also associated with growth; however,
   heterozygotes at GPI-B exhibited higher relative weight than homozygotes
   only when the paternal parent was heterozygous, indicating that the
   heterozygosity of this allozyme did not directly induce the observed
   growth advantage. No growth advantage of heterozygosity in GPI-B was
   observed when recombination occurred between GPI-B and SDG; male and
   female recombinants had similar or lower relative weights compared to
   offspring with parental genotypes. These data indicate that sex is more
   tightly linked with growth-related gene(s) than GPI-B phenotypes, and no
   evidence supported direct involvement of GPI-B in growth of channel
   catfish.

   duration) to produce meiotic gynogens or late hydrostatic pressure (90
   min post-fertilization) to produce mitotic gynogens. Polyploid hybrid
   catfish (I.punctatus X I.furcatus) were produced using eggs fertilized
   with untreated sperm followed by pressure treatments. Eggs fertilized
   with irradiated sperm (putative haploids) exhibited slow and abnormal
   development, and did not survive to hatch. Pressure treatments reduced
   the frequency of normal development at blastula, neurula and tailbud
   stages compared with stripped controls, Relative survival at 1.5 months
   was 2% for meiotic and 0.2% for mitotic gynogens, and 66% for triploid
   and 8% for tetraploid groups, compared with 27% survival of stripped
   controls. Sex ratios varied among families in hybrid groups but averaged
   close to 1:1 male:female, whereas offspring in gynogenetic families were
   all female, Particle size analysis of erythrocyte nuclear volumes
   indicated 91-100% triploidy induction, but only 4% tetraploidy
   induction, Although the numbers of gynogenetic channel catfish produced
   were small, the more than 500 viable offspring surviving represent
   foundation broodstock to facilitate genetic improvement strategies in
   this commercially important species.

   Escherichia coli, but gallic acid did not. When 500-mu-g/mL
   concentrations of these four compounds were tested in sterilized fish
   pond water at pH 7.0 and with a low bacterial inoculum of 10-3-10-4
   colony-forming units (CFU) per milliliter, they inhibited the growth of
   P. fluorescens and (except for tannic acid) E. coli. Pseudomonas
   fluorescens inoculated at 10-3-10-4 CFU/mL in pond water was inhibited
   by methyl gallate, propyl gallate, and tannic acid concentrations as low
   as 50 mu-g/mL, but a gallic acid contraction of 100 mu-g/mL was required
   for inhibition. Escherichia coli was inhibited by methyl gallate and
   propyl gallate at 250 mu-g/mL and by gallic acid at 500 mu-g/mL, but it
   was not inhibited by tannic acid at concentrations up to 500 mu-g/mL in
   water of pH 7.0. Tannic acid (500 mu-g/mL) did inhibit E. coli growth at
   pH 4.5.

AB In nitrite-exposure experiments, percent methemoglobin, plasma nitrite
   concentration, and plasma chloride ion concentration were compared
   between channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus and blue catfish L. furcatus
   exposed to sublethal levels of nitrite for 48 h at 25 degree C. In
   nitrite-recovery experiments, fish exposed to elevated environmental
   nitrite for 12 h were transferred to freshwater, and blood
   characteristics were monitored during the 24-h recovery period. Blue
   catfish appeared to be more resistant to environmental nitrite than
   channel catfish. Methemoglobin levels (percent of hemoglobin in
   methemoglobin form) were significantly lower in blue catfish than in
   channel catfish. Maximum plasma nitrite concentrations were 137 mg
   NO-2-/L plasma in blue catfish and 164 mg NO-2-/L plasma in channel
   catfish. Percent methemoglobin and plasma nitrite concentration were
   closely correlated. Plasma chloride decreased initially with exposure to
   nitrite but quickly returned to control levels. Blue catfish exposed to
   nitrite at 10 degree C required 1 week to recover when placed in
   nitrite-free water. The methemoglobin reductase enzyme apparently
   functioned at a slow rate in fish acclimated to cold temperatures.

AB Growth of male and female channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) was
   monitored for 6 months in triplicate 0.04-ha ponds (7500 fish/ha)
   stocked with mixed sexes (60-65% male), monosex males (90-98% male) or
   monosex females (98-100% female).  Average weight and length and total
   weight were not different among treatment groups at any of the monthly
   samples.  Harvest size of males was similar in ponds stocked with mixed
   sexes (mean +/- s.e.; 579 +/- 10 g and 324 +/- 2 mm, n = 184), monosex
   males (596 +/- 9 g and 326 +/- 2 mm, n = 282) and monosex females (607
   +/- 48 g and 333 +/- 6 mm, n = 3), parallel to the pattern observed for
   females in ponds stocked with mixed sexes (474 +/- 10 g and 305 +/- 2
   mm, n = 116), monosex males (458 +/- 21 g and 302 +/- 5 mm, n = 18) and
   monosex females (494 +/- 7 g and 311 +/- 1 mm, n = 297).  Males were
   significantly heavier and longer than females in ponds with mixed sexes
   and with monosex males, but females and the small number of males in
   monosex female ponds were not statistically different in size.  Feed
   conversion efficiencies were similar among treatment groups at each
   monthly sample, but the overall average for ponds with monosex males
   (0.743 +/- 0.01) was significantly higher than ponds with mixed sexes
   (0.670 +/- 0.02) and monosex females (0.676 +/- 0.01).  Intrinsic growth
   patterns for both sexes were retained in monosex and mixed sex culture,
   demonstrating that the superior growth of males has a genetic component
   and is not due simply to more aggressive feeding behavior.  The average
   weight of channel catfish harvested from monosex male ponds was about
   8.5% higher than fish in mixed sex ponds and 15% higher than fish in
   monosex female ponds, suggesting that culture of monosex male channel
   catfish could provide an economic benefit.

AB The influence of size grading on sex ratios and growth was evaluated for
   small (0.2-4.0 g) channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus). Channel catfish
   from 15 families were ungraded or were graded into two or three
   size-groups by mean of bar graders with 0.40-0.99-cm slot widths. The 57
   groups obtained were reared separately for 3-4 months in 150-L
   fiberglass tanks. Weight, length, and sex were then determined on up to
   100 fish per group. The frequency of males from all families was 51.5%;
   although progeny from individual families varied from 45.1 to 56.0%
   males, the frequencies were not different from the expected 1:1 male:
   female ratio. Males usually were preferentially selected (mean +/- SD,
   65.1 +/- 3.5%) by a grader with a slot width of 0.91 cm, which retained
   the largest fish in a population; graders with smaller slot widths did
   not consistently affect the sex distribution. Harvest size of
   fingerlings was variable and was influenced by initial weights and
   densities; family-by-grader interactions were significant (P
   less-than-or-equal-to 0.05). Sexually dimorphic growth was observed in
   19 of 57 tanks, and in those instances males were always larger than
   females. Variances for weight and length between sexes were different in
   less than 10% of the tanks, and the magnitude of the variance
   differences was significantly influenced by families. These results
   suggest that grading fingerlings as small as 3 g can affect sex ratios
   and that channel catfish families may be selected to enhance or decrease
   sex-related growth differences.

AB Reproductive performance of albino and pigmented channel catfish
   (Ictalurus punctatus) females was compared when spawning was induced
   with HCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) or Ovaprim-3 (domperidone and
   (d-Ala-6, Pro-9 NEt)-luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone). In 1985,
   only HCG was used to induce spawning. Albino females required more
   injections, had a longer latency period from time of first injection to
   spawning, and had lower spawning success (30%) than pigmented females
   (77%). No differences were observed between albino and pigmented females
   for time-of-day of spawning, number of eggs obtained by manual
   stripping, and number of eggs/kg body weight. In 1988, HCG, Ovaprim, and
   saline (control) were used to induce spawning. HCG induced spawning in
   80% of albino and 71% of pigmented females. Ovaprim induced 67% of
   pigmented females to spawn, but only 2 of 5 albino females spawned. One
   of four pigmented females injected with saline spawned. Albino females
   yielded 40-50% fewer eggs/kg body weight than pigmented females. Other
   performance characteristics for albino and pigmented females were
   similar whether injected with HCG or Ovaprim. High temperatures
   encountered during the 1985 spawning season may have had a differential
   effect on albino and pigmented fish and may account for some differences
   in spawning success.
