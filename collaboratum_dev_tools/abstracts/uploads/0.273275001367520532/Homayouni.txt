AB Background: Identification of transcription factors (TFs) responsible
   for modulation of differentially expressed genes is a key step in
   deducing gene regulatory pathways. Most current methods identify TFs by
   searching for presence of DNA binding motifs in the promoter regions of
   co-regulated genes. However, this strategy may not always be useful as
   presence of a motif does not necessarily imply a regulatory role.
   Conversely, motif presence may not be required for a TF to regulate a
   set of genes. Therefore, it is imperative to include functional
   (biochemical and molecular) associations, such as those found in the
   biomedical literature, into algorithms for identification of putative
   regulatory TFs that might be explicitly or implicitly linked to the
   genes under investigation.
   Results: In this study, we present a Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI)
   based text mining approach for identification and ranking of putative
   regulatory TFs from microarray derived differentially expressed genes
   (DEGs). Two LSI models were built using different term weighting schemes
   to devise pair-wise similarities between 21,027 mouse genes annotated in
   the Entrez Gene repository. Amongst these genes, 433 were designated TFs
   in the TRANSFAC database. The LSI derived TF-to-gene similarities were
   used to calculate TF literature enrichment p-values and rank the TFs for
   a given set of genes. We evaluated our approach using five different
   publicly available microarray datasets focusing on TFs Rel, Stat6,
   Ddit3, Stat5 and Nfic. In addition, for each of the datasets, we
   constructed gold standard TFs known to be functionally relevant to the
   study in question. Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curves
   showed that the log-entropy LSI model outperformed the tf-normal LSI
   model and a benchmark co-occurrence based method for four out of five
   datasets, as well as motif searching approaches, in identifying putative
   TFs.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that our LSI based text mining approach
   can complement existing approaches used in systems biology research to
   decipher gene regulatory networks by providing putative lists of ranked
   TFs that might be explicitly or implicitly associated with sets of DEGs
   derived from microarray experiments. In addition, unlike motif searching
   approaches, LSI based approaches can reveal TFs that may indirectly
   regulate genes.

AB Multiple sclerosis (MS) patients make antibodies to heterogeneous
   nuclear ribonuclear protein A1 (hnRNP-A1), a nucleocytoplasmic protein.
   We hypothesized this autoimmune reaction might contribute to
   neurodegeneration. Antibodies from MS patients reacted with
   hnRNP-A1-'M9', its nuclear translocation sequence. Transfection of
   anti-M9 antibodies into neurons resulted in neuronal injury and changes
   in transcripts related to hnRNP-A1 function. Importantly, RNA levels for
   the spinal paraplegia genes (SPGs) decreased. Changes in SPG RNA levels
   were confirmed in neurons purified from MS brains. Also, we show
   molecular interactions between spastin (the encoded protein of SPG4) and
   hnRNP-A1. These data suggest a link between autoimmunity, clinical
   phenotype and neurodegeneration in MS. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB High-throughput genomic technologies enable researchers to identify
   genes that are co-regulated with respect to specific experimental
   conditions. Numerous statistical approaches have been developed to
   identify differentially expressed genes. Because each approach can
   produce distinct gene sets, it is difficult for biologists to determine
   which statistical approach yields biologically relevant gene sets and is
   appropriate for their study. To address this issue, we implemented
   Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) to determine the functional coherence of
   gene sets. An LSI model was built using over 1 million Medline abstracts
   for over 20,000 mouse and human genes annotated in Entrez Gene. The
   gene-to-gene LSI-derived similarities were used to calculate a
   literature cohesion p-value (LPv) for a given gene set using a Fisher's
   exact test. We tested this method against genes in more than 6,000
   functional pathways annotated in Gene Ontology (GO) and found that
   approximately 75% of gene sets in GO biological process category and 90%
   of the gene sets in GO molecular function and cellular component
   categories were functionally cohesive (LPv < 0.05). These results
   indicate that the LPv methodology is both robust and accurate.
   Application of this method to previously published microarray datasets
   demonstrated that LPv can be helpful in selecting the appropriate
   feature extraction methods. To enable real-time calculation of LPv for
   mouse or human gene sets, we developed a web tool called Gene-set
   Cohesion Analysis Tool (GCAT). GCAT can complement other gene set
   enrichment approaches by determining the overall functional cohesion of
   data sets, taking into account both explicit and implicit gene
   interactions reported in the biomedical literature.

AB The ABC transporters Candida glabrata Cdr1 (CgCdr1), CgPdh1, and CgSnq2
   are known to mediate azole resistance in the pathogenic fungus C.
   glabrata. Activating mutations in CgPDR1, a zinc cluster transcription
   factor, result in constitutive upregulation of these ABC transporter
   genes but to various degrees. We examined the genomewide gene expression
   profiles of two matched azole-susceptible and -resistant C. glabrata
   clinical isolate pairs. Of the differentially expressed genes identified
   in the gene expression profiles for these two matched pairs, there were
   28 genes commonly upregulated with CgCDR1 in both isolate sets including
   YOR1, LCB5, RTA1, POG1, HFD1, and several members of the FLO gene family
   of flocculation genes. We then sequenced CgPDR1 from each susceptible
   and resistant isolate and found two novel activating mutations that
   conferred increased resistance when they were expressed in a common
   background strain in which CgPDR1 had been disrupted. Microarray
   analysis comparing these reengineered strains to their respective parent
   strains identified a set of commonly differentially expressed genes,
   including CgCDR1, YOR1, and YIM1, as well as genes uniquely regulated by
   specific mutations. Our results demonstrate that while CgPdr1 activates
   a broad repertoire of genes, specific activating mutations result in the
   activation of discrete subsets of this repertoire.

AB Background: Searching the enormous amount of information available in
   biomedical literature to extract novel functional relationships among
   genes remains a challenge in the field of bioinformatics. While numerous
   (software) tools have been developed to extract and identify gene
   relationships from biological databases, few effectively deal with
   extracting new (or implied) gene relationships, a process which is
   useful in interpretation of discovery-oriented genome-wide experiments.
   Results: In this study, we develop a Web-based bioinformatics software
   environment called FAUN or Feature Annotation Using Nonnegative matrix
   factorization (NMF) to facilitate both the discovery and classification
   of functional relationships among genes. Both the computational
   complexity and parameterization of NMF for processing gene sets are
   discussed. FAUN is tested on three manually constructed gene document
   collections. Its utility and performance as a knowledge discovery tool
   is demonstrated using a set of genes associated with Autism.
   Conclusions: FAUN not only assists researchers to use biomedical
   literature efficiently, but also provides utilities for knowledge
   discovery. This Web-based software environment may be useful for the
   validation and analysis of functional associations in gene subsets
   identified by high-throughput experiments.

AB Obtaining food, shelter or water, or finding a mating partner are
   examples of motivated behaviors, which are essential to preserve the
   species. The full expression of such behaviors requires a high but
   optimal arousal state. We tested the idea that tuberomammillary nucleus
   (TMN) histamine neurons are crucial to generate such motivated arousal,
   using a model of the appetitive phase of feeding behavior. Hungry rats
   enticed with food within a wire mesh box showed intense goal-directed
   motor activity aimed at opening the box, an increase in core
   temperature, a fast histamine release in the hypothalamus and an early
   increase in Fos immunoreactivity in TMN and cortical neurons. Enticing
   with stronger-tasting food induced stronger motor, temperature and Fos
   immunoreactivity brain responses than ordinary food pellets. TMN lesion
   greatly decreased all of those responses. We conclude that histamine
   neurons increase arousal and vegetative activity, allowing the normal
   unfolding of voluntary, goal-directed behavior such as obtaining food.

AB Numerous algorithms exist for producing gene sets from high-throughput
   genomic and proteomic technologies. However, analysis of the functional
   significance of these groups of genes or proteins remains a big
   challenge. We developed a web based system called Gene-set cohesion
   analysis tool (GCAT) for estimating the significance level of the
   functional cohesion of a given gene set. The method utilizes Latent
   Semantic Indexing (LSI) derived gene-gene literature similarities to
   determine if the functional coherence of a gene set is statistically
   significant compared to that expected by chance. The robustness of the
   method was determined by evaluating the functional cohesion for over
   6000 Gene Ontology categories. Here, we demonstrate the utility of GCAT
   for analysis of microarray data from previously published experiments in
   which embryonic fibroblasts were treated with interferon. Using GCAT, we
   found the highest literature cohesion p-value (p = 1.37E-63)
   corresponded to a set of genes that were differentially regulated >
   2-fold and had a t-test p-value < 0.05, compared to genes that were only
   changed > 2-fold (literature p-value = 2.2E-44) or had a p-value < 0.05
   (literature p-value = 6.0E-32). As a control, genes that were changed
   less than 2-fold or had a p-value > 0.05 did not show a significant
   literature cohesion. These results demonstrate that GCAT can provide an
   objective literature-based measure to evaluate the biological
   significance of gene sets identified by different criterions. GCAT is
   available at http://motif.memphis.edu/gcat/.

AB Background: Successful strategies for QTL gene identification benefit
   from combined experimental and bioinformatic approaches. Unique design
   aspects of the BXD recombinant inbred line mapping panel allow use of
   archived gene microarray expression data to filter likely from unlikely
   candidates. This prompted us to propose a simple five-filter protocol
   for candidate nomination. To filter more likely from less likely
   candidates, we required candidate genes near to the QTL to have mRNA
   abundance that correlated with the phenotype among the BXD lines as well
   as differed between the parental lines C57BL/6J and DBA/2J. We also
   required verification of mRNA abundance by an independent method, and
   finally we required either differences in protein levels or confirmed
   DNA sequence differences.
   Results: QTL mapping of mouse forebrain weight in 34 BXD RI lines found
   significant association on chromosomes 1 and 11, with each C57BL/6J
   allele increasing weight by more than half a standard deviation. The
   intersection of gene lists that were within +/- 10 Mb of the strongest
   associated location, that had forebrain mRNA abundance correlated with
   forebrain weight among the BXD, and that had forebrain mRNA abundance
   differing between C57BL/6J and DBA/2J, produced two candidates, Tnni1
   (troponin 1) and Asb3 (ankyrin repeat and SOCS box-containing protein
   3). Quantitative RT-PCR confirmed the direction of an increased
   expression in C57BL/6J genotype over the DBA/2J genotype for both genes,
   a difference that translated to a 2-fold difference in Asb3 protein.
   Although Tnni1 protein differences could not be confirmed, a 273 bp
   indel polymorphism was discovered 1 Kb upstream of the transcription
   start site.
   Conclusion: Delivery of well supported candidate genes following a
   single quantitative trait locus mapping experiment is difficult.
   However, by combining available gene expression data with QTL mapping,
   we illustrated a five-filter protocol that nominated Asb3 and Tnni1 as
   candidates affecting increased mouse forebrain weight. We recommend our
   approach when (1) investigators are working with phenotypic differences
   between C57BL/6J and DBA/2J, and (2) gene expression data are available
   on http://www.genenetwork.org that relate to the phenotype of interest.
   Under these circumstances, measurement of the phenotype in the BXD lines
   will likely also deliver excellent candidate genes.

AB Interferons (IFNs) are critical to the host innate immune response by
   inducing the expression of a family of early response genes, denoted as
   IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). The role of tyrosine phosphorylation of
   STAT proteins in the transcription activation of ISGs is
   well-documented. Recent studies have indicated that other transcription
   factors (TFs) are likely to play a role in regulating ISG expression.
   Here, we describe a novel integrative approach that combines gene
   expression profiling, promoter sequence analysis, and literature mining
   to screen candidate regulatory factors in the IFN signal transduction
   pathway. Application of this method identified the nuclear factor kappa
   B (NF kappa B) protein, cRel, as a candidate regulatory factor for a
   subset of ISGs in mouse embryo fibroblasts. Chromatin
   immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and real-time PCR assays confirmed that cRel
   directly binds to the promoters of several ISGs, including Cxcl10,
   Isg15, Gbp2, Ifit3, and Ifi203, and regulates their expression. Thus,
   our studies identify cRel as an important TF for ISGs, and validate the
   approach of using Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI)-based methods to
   identify regulatory factors from microarray data.

AB Background. During hematogenously disseminated candidiasis, bloodborne
   Candida albicans interacts with vascular endothelial cells (ECs), which
   have the capacity to influence the local inflammatory response to this
   organism.
   Methods. To elucidate the EC response to C. albicans, we determined the
   transcriptional profile of ECs infected with wild-type C. albicans
   strain SC5314 and a hypovirulent cph1 Delta/cph1 Delta efg1 Delta/efg1
   Delta mutant, CAN34. These EC responses were also compared to our
   previously published data on the response of the macrophage-like THP-1
   cell line to C. albicans.
   Results. Infection with strain SC5314 induced upregulation of EC genes
   involved in chemotaxis, stress response, angiogenesis, and inhibition of
   apoptosis. Infection with CAN34 induced weaker expression of fewer
   genes. The angiogenic and anti-apoptotic response of ECs to C. albicans
   did not occur in THP-1 cells. However, there was upregulation of CCL3
   and CCL4 expression in both cell types. Because CCR5 is the receptor for
   CCL3 and CCL4, we tested the susceptibility of CCR5(-/-) mice to
   disseminated candidiasis. The survival and renal fungal burden of the
   CCR5(-/-) mice were similar to that of wild-type control mice.
   Conclusions. ECs respond significantly differently to infection with C.
   albicans, compared with THP-1 cells. CCR5 is dispensable for the host
   defense against disseminated candidiasis in immunocompetent mice.

AB In the pathogenic yeast Candida albicans, the zinc cluster transcription
   factor Upc2p has been shown to regulate the expression of ERG11 and
   other genes involved in ergosterol biosynthesis upon exposure to azole
   antifungals. ERG11 encodes lanosterol demethylase, the target enzyme of
   this antifungal class. Overexpression of UPC2 reduces azole
   susceptibility, whereas its disruption results in hypersusceptibility to
   azoles and reduced accumulation of exogenous sterols. Overexpression of
   ERG11 leads to the increased production of lanosterol demethylase, which
   contributes to azole resistance in clinical isolates of C. albicans, but
   the mechanism for this has yet to be determined. Using genome-wide gene
   expression profiling, we found UPC2 and other genes involved in
   ergosterol biosynthesis to be coordinately upregulated with ERG11 in a
   fluconazole-resistant clinical isolate compared with a matched
   susceptible isolate from the same patient. Sequence analysis of the UPC2
   alleles of these isolates revealed that the resistant isolate contained
   a single-nucleotide substitution in one UPC2 allele that resulted in a
   G648D exchange in the encoded protein. Introduction of the mutated
   allele into a drug-susceptible strain resulted in constitutive
   upregulation of ERG11 and increased resistance to fluconazole. By
   comparing the gene expression profiles of the fluconazole-resistant
   isolate and of strains carrying wild-type and mutated UPC2 alleles, we
   identified target genes that are controlled by Upc2p. Here we show for
   the first time that a gain-of-function mutation in UPC2 leads to the
   increased expression of ERG11 and imparts resistance to fluconazole in
   clinical isolates of C. albicans.

   presents a major challenge for determining the functional relationships
   among genes. In this study, we develop a Web-based bioinformatics
   software environment called FAUN or Feature Annotation Using Nonnegative
   matrix factorization (NMF) to facilitate both the discovery and
   classification of functional relationships among genes. Both the
   computational complexity and parameterization of NAIF for processing
   gene sets are discussed. We tested FAUN on three manually constructed
   gene document collections, and then used it to analyze several
   microarray-derived gene sets obtained from studies of the developing
   cerebellum in normal and mutant mice. FAUN provides utilities for
   collaborative knowledge discovery and identification of new gene
   relationships from text streams and repositories (e.g., MEDLINE). It is
   particularly useful for the validation and analysis of gene associations
   suggested by microarray experimentation.

AB A major mechanism of azole resistance in Candida albicans is
   overexpression of the genes encoding the ATP binding cassette
   transporters Cdr1p and Cdr2p due to gain-of-function mutations in Tac1p,
   a transcription factor of the zinc cluster family. To identify the Tac1p
   regulon, we analyzed four matched sets of clinical isolates representing
   the development of CDR1 - and CDR2-mediated azole resistance by using
   gene expression profiling. We identified 31 genes that were consistently
   up-regulated with CDR1 and CDR2, including TACI itself, and 12
   consistently down-regulated genes. When a resistant strain deleted for
   TACI was examined similarly, expression of almost all of these genes
   returned to levels similar to those in the matched azole-susceptible
   isolate. Using genome-wide location (ChIP-chip) analysis (a procedure
   combining chromatin immunoprecipitation with hybridization to DNA
   intergenic microarrays), we found 37 genes whose promoters were bound by
   Tac1p in vivo, including CDR1 and CDR2. Sequence analysis identified
   nine new genes whose promoters contain the previously reported Tac1p
   drug-responsive element (CGGN(4)CGG), including TAC1 In total, there
   were eight genes whose expression was modulated in the four
   azole-resistant clinical isolates in a TACI-dependent manner and whose
   promoters were bound by Tac1p, qualifying them as direct Tac1p targets:
   CDR1, CDR2, GPX1 (putative glutathione peroxidase), LCB4 (putative
   sphingosine kinase), RTA3 (putative phospholipid flippase), and
   orf19.1887 (putative lipase), as well as IFU5 and orf19.4898 of unknown
   function. Our results show that Tac1p binds under nonactivating
   conditions to the promoters of its targets, including to its own
   promoter. They also suggest roles for Tac1p in regulating lipid
   metabolism (mobilization and trafficking) and oxidative stress response
   in C. albicans.

AB Constitutive overexpression of the MDR1 ( multidrug resistance) gene,
   which encodes a multidrug efflux pump of the major facilitator
   superfamily, is a frequent cause of resistance to fluconazole and other
   toxic compounds in clinical Candida albicans strains, but the mechanism
   of MDR1 upregulation has not been resolved. By genome-wide gene
   expression analysis we have identified a zinc cluster transcription
   factor, designated as MRR1 ( multidrug resistance regulator), that was
   coordinately upregulated with MDR1 in drug-resistant, clinical C.
   albicans isolates. Inactivation of MRR1 in two such drug-resistant
   isolates abolished both MDR1 expression and multidrug resistance.
   Sequence analysis of the MRR1 alleles of two matched drug-sensitive and
   drug-resistant C. albicans isolate pairs showed that the resistant
   isolates had become homozygous for MRR1 alleles that contained single
   nucleotide substitutions, resulting in a P683S exchange in one isolate
   and a G997V substitution in the other isolate. Introduction of these
   mutated alleles into a drug-susceptible C. albicans strain resulted in
   constitutive MDR1 overexpression and multidrug resistance. By comparing
   the transcriptional profiles of drug-resistant C. albicans isolates and
   mrr1 Delta mutants derived from them and of C. albicans strains carrying
   wild-type and mutated MRR1 alleles, we defined the target genes that are
   controlled by Mrr1p. Many of the Mrr1p target genes encode
   oxidoreductases, whose upregulation in fluconazole-resistant isolates
   may help to prevent cell damage resulting from the generation of toxic
   molecules in the presence of fluconazole and thereby contribute to drug
   resistance. The identification of MRR1 as the central regulator of the
   MDR1 efflux pump and the elucidation of the mutations that have occurred
   in fluconazole-resistant, clinical C. albicans isolates and result in
   constitutive activity of this trancription factor provide detailed
   insights into the molecular basis of multidrug resistance in this
   important human fungal pathogen.

AB The central and peripheral nervous systems exhibit significant
   embryological, morphological, and functional differences. Moreover, the
   pathology of most acquired and hereditary neurological diseases
   preferentially targets specific components of the nervous system. In
   order to test the hypothesis that central and peripheral neural
   transcriptomes show fundamental quantitative differences, Affymetrix
   GeneChip (R) expression arrays were used to compare murine lumbar spinal
   cord (SC) and dorsal root ganglion (DRG) gene expression. As the crucial
   component of a novel technique to preserve RNA integrity, mice were
   perfusion-fixed with RNAlater (TM) before the SC and DRG were harvested.
   As per Affymetrix terminology, a total of 111 transcripts were present
   (P) on all DRG arrays, absent (A) on all SC arrays, and demonstrated at
   least 10-fold greater expression in DRG than in SC. Conversely, a total
   of 112 transcripts were present on all SC arrays, absent on all DRG
   arrays, and showed at least 10-fold greater expression in SC than in
   DRG. For a subset of transcripts, quantitative real-time RT-PCR was used
   to corroborate and validate microarray results. Among those genes
   enriched in DRG, many belonged to a few distinct functional classes:
   G-protein coupled receptor-protein signaling pathways, potassium
   transport, sodium transport, sensory perception, and cell-surface
   receptor-linked signal transduction. In contrast, genes associated with
   synaptic transmission, organic acid transport, neurotransmitter
   transport, and circulation were enriched in SC. Notably, the majority of
   genes causally associated with hereditary neuropathies were highly
   enriched in DRG. These differential neural gene expression profiles
   provide a robust framework for future molecular and genetic studies of
   neuropathy and SC diseases. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Candida glabrata emerged in the last decade as a common cause of mucosal
   and invasive fungal infection, in large part due to its intrinsic or
   acquired resistance to azole antifungals such as fluconazole. In C.
   glabrata clinical isolates, the predominant mechanism behind azole
   resistance is upregulated expression of multidrug transporter genes CDR1
   and PDH1. We previously reported that azole-resistant mutants (MIC >= 64
   mu g ml(-1)) of strain 66032 (MIC = 16 mu g ml(-1)) similarly show
   coordinate CDR1-PDH1 upregulation, and in one of these (F15) a putative
   gain-of-function mutation was identified in the single homologue of
   Saccharomyces cerevisiae transcription factors Pdr1-Pdr3. Here we show
   that disruption of C. glabrata PDR1 conferred equivalent fluconazole
   hypersensitivity (MIC = 2 mu g ml(-1)) to both F15 and 66032 and
   eliminated both constitutive and fluconazole-induced CDR1-PDH1
   expression. Reintroduction of wild-type or F15 PDR1 fully reversed these
   effects; together these results demonstrate a role for this gene in both
   acquired and intrinsic azole resistance. CDR1 disruption had a partial
   effect, reducing fluconazole trailing in both strains while restoring
   wild-type susceptibility (MIC = 16 mu g ml(-1)) to F15. In an
   azole-resistant clinical isolate, PDR1 disruption reduced azole MICs
   eight- to 64-fold with no effect on sensitivity to other antifungals. To
   extend this analysis, C. glabrata microarrays were generated and used to
   analyse genome-wide expression in F15 relative to its parent. Homologues
   of 10 S. cerevisiae genes previously shown to be Pdr1-Pdr3 targets were
   upregulated (YOR1, RTA1, RSB1, RPN4, YLR346c and YMR102c along with
   CDR1, PDH1 and PDR1 itself) or downregulated (PDR12); roles for these
   genes include small molecule transport and transcriptional regulation.
   However, expression of 99 additional genes was specifically altered in
   C. glabrata F15; their roles include transport (e.g. QDR2, YBT1), lipid
   metabolism (ATF2, ARE1), cell stress (HSP12, CTA1), DNA repair (YIM1,
   MEC3) and cell wall function (MKC7, MNT3). These azole
   resistance-associated changes could affect C. glabrata tissue-specific
   virulence; in support of this, we detected differences in F15 oxidant,
   alcohol and weak acid sensitivities. C. glabrata provides a promising
   model for studying the genetic basis of multidrug resistance and its
   impact on virulence.

AB Gene expression QTL (eQTL) mapping can suggest candidate regulatory
   relationships between genes. Recent advances in mammalian phenotype
   annotation such as mammalian phenotype ontology (MPO) enable systematic
   analysis of the phenotypic spectrum subserved by many genes. In this
   study we combined eQTL mapping and phenotypic spectrum analysis to
   predict gene regulatory relationships. Five pairs of genes with similar
   phenotypic effects and potential regulatory relationships suggested by
   eQTL mapping were identified. Lines of evidence supporting some of the
   predicted regulatory relationships were obtained from biological
   literature. A particularly notable example is that promoter sequence
   analysis and real-time PCR assays support the predicted regulation of
   protein kinase C epsilon (Prkce) by cAMP responsive element binding
   protein 1 (Creb1). Our results show that the combination of gene eQTL
   mapping and phenotypic spectrum analysis may provide a valuable approach
   to uncovering gene regulatory relations underlying mammalian phenotypes.

AB Interferons (IFNs) are antiviral cytokines that selectively regulate
   gene expression through several signaling pathways including nuclear
   factor kappa B (NF kappa B). To investigate the specific role of NF
   kappa B in IFN signaling, we performed gene expression profiling after
   IFN treatment of embryonic fibroblasts derived from normal mice or mice
   with targeted deletion of NF kappa B p50 and p65 genes. Interestingly,
   several antiviral and immunomodulatory genes were induced higher by IFN
   in NF kappa B knock-out cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments
   demonstrated that NF kappa B was basally bound to the promoters of these
   genes, while IFN treatment resulted in the recruitment of STAT1 and
   STAT2 to these promoters. However, in NF kappa B knock-out cells IFN
   induced STAT binding as well as the binding of the IFN regulatory
   factor-1 (IRF1) to the IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) promoters. IRF1 binding
   closely correlated with enhanced gene induction. Moreover, NF kappa B
   suppressed both antiviral and immunomodulatory actions of IFN against
   influenza virus. Our results identify a novel negative regulatory role
   of NF kappa B in IFN-induced gene expression and biological activities
   and suggest that modulating NF kappa B activity may provide a new avenue
   for enhancing the therapeutic effectiveness of IFN.

   C-terminal region of APP family proteins and ubiquitous mitochondrial
   creatine kinase (uMtCK). This interaction was confirmed in vitro as well
   as in cultured cells and in brain. Interestingly, expression of

AB Cytosolic brain-type creatine kinase (BB-CK), which is coexpressed with
   ubiquitous mitochondrial uMtCK, is significantly inactivated by
   oxidation in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Since CK has been shown
   to play a fundamental role in cellular energetics of the brain, any
   disturbance of this enzyme may exasperate the AD disease process.
   Mutations in amyloid precursor protein (APP) are associated with early
   onset AD and result in abnormal processing of APP, and accumulation of A
   beta peptide, the main constituent of amyloid plaques in AD brain.
   Recent data on a direct interaction between APP and the precursor of
   uMtCK support an emerging relationship between AD, cellular energy
   levels, and mitochondrial function. In addition, recently discovered
   creatine (Cr) deposits in the brain of transgenic AD mice, as well as in
   the hippocampus from AD patients, indicate a direct link between
   perturbed energy state, Cr metabolism, and AD. Here, we review the roles
   of Cr and Cr-related enzymes and consider the potential value of
   supplementation with Cr, a potent neuroprotective substance. As a
   hypothesis, we consider whether Cr, if given at an early time point of
   the disease, may prevent or delay the course of AD-related
   neurodegeneration.

   agents used in the treatment of systemic fungal infections. Ketoconazole
   exposure increased expression of genes involved in lipid, fatty acid,
   and sterol metabolism, including NCP1, MCR1, CYB5, ERG2, ERG3, ERG10,
   ERG25, ERG251, and that encoding the azole target, ERG11. Ketoconazole
   also increased expression of several genes associated with azole

   produced changes in the expression of genes involved in small-molecule
   transport (ENA21), and in cell stress (YHB1, CTA1, AOX1, and SOD2). Also
   observed was decreased expression of genes involved in ergosterol

   expression of genes encoding cell wall maintenance proteins, including
   the &beta;-1,3-glucan synthase subunit GSL22, as well as PHR1, ECM21,
   ECM33, and FEN12. Flucytosine increased the expression of proteins

   was used to confirm microarray results. Genes responding similarly to

AB Motivation: A major challenge in the interpretation of high-throughput
   genomic data is understanding the functional associations between genes.
   Previously, several approaches have been described to extract gene
   relationships from various biological databases using term-matching
   methods. However, more flexible automated methods are needed to identify
   functional relationships (both explicit and implicit) between genes from
   the biomedical literature. In this study, we explored the utility of
   Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI), a vector space model for information
   retrieval, to automatically identify conceptual gene relationships from
   titles and abstracts in MEDLINE citations.
   Results: We found that LSI identified gene-to-gene and keyword-to-gene
   relationships with high average precision. In addition, LSI identified
   implicit gene relationships based on word usage patterns in the gene
   abstract documents. Finally, we demonstrate here that pairwise distances
   derived from the vector angles of gene abstract documents can be
   effectively used to functionally group genes by hierarchical clustering.
   Our results provide proof-of-principle that LSI is a robust automated

AB Interferons (IFNs) play critical roles in host defense by modulating the
   expression of various genes via tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT
   transcription factors. IFN-alpha/beta activates another important
   transcription factor, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), but its role in
   IFN-mediated activity is poorly understood. Sensitivity to the antiviral
   and gene-inducing effects of IFN was examined in normal fibroblasts and
   in NF-kappaB knockout fibroblasts from p50- and p65-null mice. Antiviral
   assays demonstrated that NF-kappaB knockout fibroblasts were sensitized
   to the antiviral action of IFN. Moreover, analysis of IFN-stimulated
   gene expression by real-time PCR demonstrated selective effects of
   NF-kappaB on gene expression. Our results demonstrate that a subset of
   IFN-stimulated genes is regulated through an NF-kappaB-dependent pathway
   and that NF-kappaB may regulate the sensitivity of cells to IFN-mediated
   antiviral activity.

AB The Reelin signaling pathway controls neuronal positioning during
   mammalian brain development by binding to the very low density
   lipoprotein receptor and apolipoprotein E receptor-2, and signaling
   through the intracellular adapter protein Disabled-1 (Dab1). To identify
   new components in the Reelin signaling pathway, we used a yeast
   two-hybrid screen to select Dab1-interacting proteins. Here, we report
   the characterization of a new mouse Dab1l-interacting protein that is
   orthologous to rat Dab2IP, a Ras-GTPase activating protein previously
   shown to bind to Dab2/DOC. The interaction of Dab1 and Dab2IP was
   confirmed in biochemical assays and by co-immunoprecipitation from brain
   lysates. The site of interaction between Dab1 and Dab2IP was narrowed to
   the Dab1-PTB domain and the NPxY motif in Dab2IP. The deduced amino acid
   sequence of mouse Dab2IP encompasses 1208 residues containing several
   protein interaction motifs as well as a Ras-like GAP-related domain.
   Northern blot analysis revealed at least two isoforms of Dab2IP mRNA in
   the brain, both of which exhibited increased expression during
   development. In situ hybridization analyses indicated that Dab2IP mRNA
   is diffusely expressed throughout the developing and the adult brain.
   Using a polyclonal antiserum specific for Dab2IP, we observed protein
   expression in the soma and processes of neurons in a variety of brain
   structures, including the developing cerebral cortex. Our findings
   suggest that Dab2IP may function as a downstream effector in the Reelin
   signaling pathway that influences Ras signaling during brain
   development. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Disabled-1 (Dab1) is an intracellular adapter protein that mediates the
   effect of Reelin on neuronal migration and cell positioning during
   mammalian brain. development. To identify components of the Reelin-Dab1
   signaling pathway, we searched for proteins that interact with Dab1
   using a yeast two-hybrid strategy. We found that the Dab1
   phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain interacts with a novel
   protocadherin, orthologous to human protocadherin 18. Mouse Pcdh18
   (mPcdh18), which consists of four exons similar to other protocadherin
   family members, maps to chromosome 3. The deduced amino acid sequence of
   mPcdh18 contains six extracellular cadherin motifs, a single
   transmembrane region, and a large intracellular domain. The site of Dab1
   interaction was localized to the C-terminal 243 residues of mPcdh18.
   Expression analyses revealed that mPcdh18 is present in a variety of
   tissues in the embryo, but in adult mice it is primarily expressed in
   lung and kidney. In embryonic brain, mPcdhl8 expression is temporally
   and spatially regulated. Our results indicate that mPcdhl8 participates
   in signaling pathways involving PTB-containing proteins and suggest that
   it may play a role during brain development. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science.

AB A signaling pathway involving the extracellular protein Reelin and the
   intracellular adaptor protein Disabled-1 (Dab1) controls cell
   positioning during mammalian brain development. Here, we demonstrate
   that Reelin binds directly to lipoprotein receptors, preferably the very
   low-density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) and apolipoprotein E receptor 2
   (ApoER2). Binding requires calcium, and it is inhibited in the presence
   of apoE. Furthermore, the CR-50 monoclonal antibody, which inhibits
   Reelin function, blocks the association of Reelin with VLDLR. After
   binding to VLDLR on the cell surface, Reelin is internalized into
   vesicles. In dissociated neurons, apoE reduces the level of
   Reelin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Dab1. These data suggest that
   Reelin directs neuronal migration by binding to VLDLR and ApoER2.

AB Disruption of the disabled-1 gene (Dab1) results in aberrant migration
   of neurons during development and disorganization of laminar structures
   throughout the brain. Dab1 is thought to function as an adapter molecule
   in signal transduction processes. It contains a protein-interaction (PI)
   domain similar to the phosphotyrosine-binding domain of the Shc
   oncoprotein, it is phosphorylated by the Src protein tyrosine kinase,
   and it binds to SH2 domains in a phosphotyrosine-dependent manner. To
   investigate the function of Dab1, we searched for binding proteins using
   the yeast two-hybrid system. We found that the PI domain of Dab1
   interacts with the amyloid precursor-like protein 1 (APLP1). The
   association of Dab1 with APLP1 was confirmed in biochemical assays, and
   the site of interaction was localized to a cytoplasmic region of APLP1
   containing the amino acid sequence motif Asn-Pro-x-Tyr (NPxY). NPxY
   motifs are involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and they have been
   shown to bind to PI domains present in several proteins. This region of
   APLP1 is conserved among all members of the amyloid precursor family of
   proteins. Indeed, we found that Dab1 also interacts with amyloid
   precursor protein (APP) and APLP2 in biochemical association
   experiments. In transiently transfected cells, Dab1 and APLP1
   colocalized in membrane ruffles and vesicular structures. Cotransfection
   assays in cultured cells indicated that APP family members increased
   serine phosphorylation of Dab1. Dab1 and APLP1 are expressed in similar
   cell populations in developing and adult brain tissue. These results
   suggest that Dab1 may function, at least in part, through association
   with APLP1 in the brain.
