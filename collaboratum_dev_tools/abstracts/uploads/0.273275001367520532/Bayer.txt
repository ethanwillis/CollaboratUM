AB The systematic position of the monoecious rheophyte, Sheareria
   (Asteraceae), a genus endemic to China, has been long disputed and never
   rigorously examined. In this study, two molecular datasets (trnL-F,
   ITS), Plus morphological and cytological characters, were used to assess
   the systematic position of Sheareria. The broader phylogenetic analyses
   based on the trnL-F data placed Sheareria in the tribe Astereae with
   strong support. This placement was also supported by the lanceolate
   style, "Asteroid type" ligule epidermis, yellow anthers, green achenes,
   and basic chromosome number of x = 9. Analysis of the tribe Astereae
   based oil the ITS dataset showed that Sheareria and three East Asian
   genera (Kalimeris, Aster, Rhynchospermum) formed a strongly Supported
   clade characterized by flat, 2-ribbed, glandular disc achenes. Detailed
   morphological comparisons indicate that Sheareria is more similar to
   Kalimeris than to Rhynchospermum. Within this clade, Sheareria is
   distinguished from other genera by its monoecious breeding system (vs.
   gynomonoecious). Based on fossil and geological evidence, the
   development of monoecy in Sheareria is discussed. Within Sheareria, only
   one species, S. nana, is recognized; S. leshanensis, a newly described
   species, is placed in synonymy.

AB The breeding of new, high-quality citrus cultivars depends on dependable
   information about the relationships of taxa within the tribe Citreae;
   therefore, it is important to have a well-supported phylogeny of the
   relationships between species not only to advance breeding strategies,
   but also to advance conservation strategies for the wild taxa. The
   recent history of the systematics of Citrus (Rutaceae: Aurantioideae)
   and its allies, in the context of Rutaceae taxonomy as a whole, is
   reviewed. The most recent classification is tested using nine cpDNA
   sequence regions in representatives of all genera of the subfam.
   Aurantioideae (save Limnocitrus) and numerous species and hybrids
   referred to Citrus s.l. Aurantioideae are confirmed as monophyletic.
   Within Aurantioideae, tribe Clauseneae are not monophyletic unless
   Murraya s.s. and Merrillia are removed to Aurantieae. Within tribe
   Aurantieae, the three traditionally recognized subtribes are not
   monophyletic. Triphasiinae is not monophyletic unless Oxanthera is
   returned to Citrus (Citrinae). Balsamocitrinae is polyphyletic.
   Feroniella, traditionally considered allied closely to Limonia
   (=Feronia), is shown to be nested in Citrus. The proposed congenericity
   of Severinia and Atalantia is confirmed. The most recent circumscription
   of Citrus is strongly supported by this analysis, with hybrids appearing
   with their putative maternal parents. The genus was resolved into two
   clades, one comprising wild species from New Guinea, Australia, and New
   Caledonia (formerly Clymenia, Eremocitrus, Microcitrus, Oxanthera), but
   surprisingly also Citrus medica, traditionally believed to be native in
   India. The second clade is largely from the Asian mainland (including
   species formerly referred to Fortunella and Poncirus).

AB Hemlock, Tsuga (Pinaceae), has a disjunct distribution in North America
   and Asia. To examine the biogeographic history of Tsuga, phylogenetic
   relationships among multiple accessions of all nine species were
   inferred using chloroplast DNA sequences and multiple cloned sequences
   of the nuclear ribosomal ITS region. Analysis of chloroplast and ITS
   sequences resolve a clade that includes the two western North American
   species, T. heterophylla and T. mertensiana, and a clade of Asian
   species within which one of the eastern North American species, T.
   caroliniona, is nested. The other eastern North American species, T.
   canadensis, is sister to the Asian clade. Tsuga chinensis from Taiwan
   did not group with T. chinensis from mainland China, and T. sieboldii
   from Ullung Island did not group with T. sieboldii from Japan suggesting
   that the taxonomic status of these distinct populations should be
   reevaluated. The Himalayan species, T. dumosa, was in conflicting
   positions in the chloroplast and ITS trees, suggesting that it may be of
   hybrid origin. Likelihood-based biogeographic inference with divergence
   time estimates infers an Eocene basal crown group diversification and
   all initial widespread circumpolar distribution with subsequent
   vicariance and extinction events leading to the Current disjunct
   distribution.

AB Hopea and Shorea are economically important timber tree genera
   distributed throughout South-East Asia. The taxonomic limits of these
   genera are problematic. Molecular phylogenies of Hopea and Shorea were
   inferred using two non-coding regions of chloroplast (trnL-trnF) and
   nuclear ribosomal (internal transcribed spacer) DNA. The inferred
   phylogenetic relationships between Hopea and Shorea indicate that Shorea
   is paraphyletic and that Hopea is potentially monophyletic (particularly
   section Drijobalanoides). The inferred groupings within Shorea are very
   similar to a previous classification based on timber characteristics.
   The present study also identified four anomalous taxa, whose

AB The phylogenetic relationships between the tribes Inuleae sensu stricto
   and Plucheeae are investigated by analysis of sequence data from the
   cpDNA gene ndhF. The delimitation between the two tribes is elucidated,
   and the systematic positions of a number of genera associated with these
   groups, i.e. genera with either aberrant morphological characters or a
   debated systematic position, are clarified. Together, the Inuleae and
   Plucheeae form a monophyletic group in which the majority of genera of
   Inuleae s.str. form one clade, and all the taxa from the Plucheeae
   together with the genera Antiphiona, Calostephane, Geigeria, Ondetia,
   Pechuel-loeschea, Pegolettia, and Iphionopsis from Inuleae s.str. form
   another. Members of the Plucheeae are nested with genera of the Inuleae
   s.str., and support for the Plucheeae clade is weak. Consequently, the
   latter cannot be maintained and the two groups are treated as one tribe,
   Inuleae, with the two subtribes Inulinae and Plucheinae. The genera
   Asteriscus, Chrysophthaltmum, Inula, Laggera, Pentanema, Pluchea, and
   Pulicaria are demonstrated to be non-monophyletic. Craystylis and
   Iphionopsis are found to belong to the same clade as the taxa of the
   former Plucheeae. Caesulia is shown to be a close relative of Duhaldea
   and Blumea of the Inuleae-Intilinae. The genera Callilepis and
   Zoutpansbergia belong to the major clade of the family that includes the
   tribes Heliantheae sensu lato and Inuleae (Incl. Plucheeae), but their
   exact position remains unresolved. The genus Gymnarrhena is not part of
   the Inuleae, but is either part of the unresolved basal complex of the
   paraphyletic Cichorioideae, or sister to the entire Asteroideae. (c)

AB One of every 10 flowering plant species is in the family Compositae.
   With ca. 24,000-30,000 species in 1600-1700 genera and a distribution
   that is global except for Antarctica, it is the most diverse of all
   plant families. Although clearly monophyletic, there is a great deal of
   diversity among the members: habit varies from annual and perennial
   herbs to shrubs, vines, or trees, and species grow in nearly every type
   of habitat from lowland forests to the high alpine fell fields, though
   they are most. common in open areas. Some are well-known weeds, but most
   species have restricted distributions, and members of this family are
   often important components of 'at risk' habitats as in the Cape Floral
   Kingdom or the Hawaiian Islands. The sub-familial classification and
   ideas about major patterns of evolution and diversification within the
   family remained largely unchanged from Bentham through Cronquist.
   Recently obtained data, both morphological and molecular, have allowed
   us to examine the distribution and evolution of the family in a way that
   was never before possible. It is now known that the tribe formerly
   thought to be ancestral (Heliantheae s. l.) is actually nested high in
   the phylogeny while one previously thought to be in a derived position
   (Mutisieae s. L) is basal. Likewise, tribes previously thought to be
   closely related, Eupatorieae and Vernonieae, are now widely separated,
   and the Cardueae (thistles) are embedded in the African Mutisieae clade.
   The results of recent broad-scale molecular studies of the tribes, both
   published and unpublished, were used to produce a supertree formed by
   linking the respective trees together. By examining the distribution of
   the terminal taxa on the phylogeny using parsimony analysis with
   optimization and ancestral areas analysis, a biogeographic pattern
   emerges. Basal lineages of the family as well as the sister group
   Calyceraceae, are all South American and mostly southern South American,
   and it appears incontrovertible that the origin of extant members of the
   Compositae was in southern South America. Although numerous, these basal
   clades represent only a small percentage of the diversity in the family.
   A subsequent radiation in Africa gave rise to most of the tribes we know
   today. The African radiation was followed by the movement of individual
   clades into Asia and Eurasia as well as Australia. Finally, there was a
   North American origin and diversification of the Heliantheae s. l. that
   involved repeated incursions into Mexico and South America. The South
   American radiation followed by the African explosion might suggest a
   Gondwanan origin for the family, but the few data that exist from pollen
   records and geology seem to indicate a more recent origin for the
   family. The existence of the monotypic genus Hecastocleis, endemic to
   the mountains of Nevada and Death Valley, inserts a North American taxon
   in between the South American and African radiations which might
   indicate long distance dispersal, or a North American or even an Asian
   presence in between South America and Africa. Also of interest is the
   geographic origin of the ancestor of the Heliantheae s. l. clade. The
   sister-group to the western hemisphere clade Heliantheae s. L is the
   small tribe Athroismeae, a group of three genera from eastern tropical
   Africa, leaving a unknown area, possibly Asia, between Africa and
   western North America. This global picture of the Compositae provides a
   framework for studies in morphology and clearly indicates the need for
   future molecular and morphological studies.

   chloroplast DNA (the trnK 5' intron, psbA/trnH intergenic spacer, trnL
   intron and adjacent trnL/trnF intergenic spacer) and nuclear ribosomal
   DNA (ETS and ITS) markers. Oxylobium is shown to be polyphyletic, while
   Gastrolobium is paraphyletic, containing within it the genera
   Brachysema, Jansonia and Nemcia, as well as Oxylobium lineare. This
   concurs with a previous molecular analysis and the results of the two

   ovule number and fluoroacetate content, are shown to be homoplastic and
   suites of characters for defining the different genera using different
   morphological characters are presented. Our results support a recent
   monograph that expands Gastrolobium to include Brachysema, Jansonia,
   Nemcia and Oxylobium lineare. This revision leaves Oxylobium and
   Podolobium occurring exclusively in eastern Australia, while
   Gastrolobium occurs almost exclusively in south-western Australia, with

   characterised by adult foliage consisting of phyllodes. Molecular
   sequence data from the internal transcribed spacers (ITS) of the nuclear
   ribosomal DNA repeat were used to investigate the monophyly of seven
   sections within the subgenus. A nested PCR approach was used to amplify
   the ITS region. Fifty-one species representative of all sections were
   sequenced together with one outgroup taxon Lysiloma divaricata (Ingeae).
   Phylogenetic parsimony analysis suggested that there are two main clades
   within Phyllodineae but that only one section, Lycopodiifoliae, is
   apparently monophyletic. In one of the main clades, Lycopodifoliae is
   related to some taxa in sections Alatae and Pulchellae and some members
   of section Phyllodineae. In the second main clade, sections Juliflorae,
   Plurinerves and Botrycephalae cluster with other members of section
   Phyllodineae. The two sections that are characterised by bipinnate
   foliage, Botrycephalae and Pulchellae, are nested within phyllodinous
   clades, indicating that at least two separate reversals to bipinnate
   leaves have occurred. Botrycephalae is paraphyletic with respect to taxa
   from section Phyllodineae that have uninerved phyllodes and racemose
   inflorescences.

   divisions are found based on biogeography, New World versus

AB The mulga complex (Acacia aneura and closely related taxa) is a
   widespread group that is dominant in much of arid Australia. The group
   is taxonomically difficult, due to a complex interaction of sympatry and
   putative hybridisation between the major species, geographic variation
   within species and sympatric variation within A. aneura. Mulga is highly
   variable in a wide range of vegetative and reproductive characters and
   it is not unusual to find five or six distinct forms growing side by
   side. The aim of this project was to gain a better understanding of the
   relationships among mulga species and A. aneura varieties, as well as
   the maintenance of this variation. A single site in the Northern
   Territory, containing A. ayersiana, A. minyura and two varieties of A.
   aneura, was sampled intensively. Six morphotypes were observed in the
   field and five were strongly supported by morphometric analysis.
   Although the mulga complex is generally tetraploid (2n = 52), triploid
   (2n = 39) and pentaploid (2n = 65) seedlings were produced in the study
   population. Microsatellite primers developed for A. mangium (sect.
   Juliflorae) were amplified in individuals of each morphotype, resulting
   in genetic marker patterns consistent with polyploidy. Genetic and
   morphometric distances were correlated and differences between
   morphotypes account for 63% of the total genetic variation (phiPT =
   0.63, P < 0.001). Allele sequences confirmed the presence of genuine
   heterozygosity and clonality was suggested by the low genotypic
   diversity and the lack of allele segregation. Seedlings had identical
   genotypes to the maternal plants and polyembryony was observed in each
   taxon, consistent with apomictic reproduction. Both apomixis and ploidy
   level variation may restrict gene flow among morphotypes, playing a role
   in the maintenance of morphological diversity at the study site. The
   success of the group in arid and semi-arid Australia may also be due, in
   part, to these factors.

   Results indicate that the subtribes Angianthinae and Cassinimae are
   non-monophyletic as currently circumscribed. There is also some evidence
   to suggest that the genera Asteridea, Craspedia, Hyalosperma, Millotia,
   and Podolepis are monophyletic, whereas Calocephalus, Gnephosis,
   Myriocephalus pro parte, Ozothamnus, Siloxerus, Trichanthodium, and
   Xerochrysum are non-monophyletic. A group of perennial shrubs and alpine
   cushion plants from southeastern Australia dominates the clade at the
   base of the Gnaphalieae. The more derived clades contain primarily
   herbaceous annual taxa, mainly from western Australia. Based on our
   results, it seems likely that initial colonization and diversification
   of the Australian Gnaphalieae occurred in the Bassian Floristic region
   in eastern New South Wales, Victoria, and Tasmania. Following
   diversification in eastern Australia, concurrent with the increasing
   aridity over the entire continent during the Miocene, a massive
   radiation in the Gnaphalieae occurred into the and zone of South
   Australia and Western Australia.

   agreement on generic (notably the distinctness of Heterozostera) and
   subgeneric delimitation, Recent anatomical, developmental, and molecular
   studies urge a reevaluation of relationship, in the family, To clarify
   the taxonomy Of Zosteraceae, we investigated interspecific phylogenetic
   relationships focusing on Australian species, of subgenus Zosterella, We
   examined material comprising all genera of Zosteraceae (Heterozostera,
   Nanozostera, Phyllospadix, Zostera), six/seven species of Zostera
   subgenus Zosterella (including all Australian/New Zealand species), and
   one Of four species of Zostera subgenus Zostera. We conducted
   phylogenetic analyses of morphological data and DNA sequences from
   nuclear (ITS) and plastid (trnK intron, rbcL) genomes. Our results
   indicate two major clades (highly divergent at both morphological and
   molecular levels) and two subclades (with low morphological and
   molecular divergence) within Zosteraceae, Little morphological and
   molecular variation was observed among representatives within the clade
   of Australian/New, Zealand members Of subgenus Zosterella, and none
   provided cladistic support for taxa recognized formerly as separate
   species, We recommend that Zosteraceae comprise two genera
   (Phyllospadix, Zostera) with the latter subdivided into three subgenera
   (Zostera, Zosterella, Heterozostera). Furthermore, Australian/New
   Zealand representatives of Zostera subgenus Zosterella should be merged
   within a single species (Z. capricorni) to reflect the inability of

   of Gastrolobium and the related genera Brachysema, Callistachys,

   data from three regions-the psbA-trnH intergenic spacer and the trnK 5'
   intron from chloroplast DNA and the 3' end of the external transcribed
   spacer (ETS) from nuclear ribosomal DNA. Gastrolobium is shown to be
   paraphyletic, with Brachysema, Jansonia, Nemcia, and Oxylobium lineare
   nesting within it, and Nemcia is shown to be polyphyletic within
   Gastrolobium. Past key morphological characters, such as fluoroacetate
   content and characters associated with pollination syndrome, are shown
   to be homoplastic, with fluoroacetate possibly a plesiomorphic condition
   lost in more derived species. Podolobium is also shown to be
   polyphyletic, with the P. ilicifolium group sister to Gastrolobium and
   the P. alpestre group sister to Callistachys, a member of the Oxylobium
   group. It is recommended that Gastrolobium be expanded to include
   Brachysema, Jansonia, Nemcia, and Oxylobium lineare, while further work

   Acacia, subg. Aculeiferum, and the predominantly Australian subg.
   Phyllodineae. Morphological studies have suggested the tribe Acacieae
   and genus Acacia are artificial and have a close affinity to the tribe
   Ingeae. Based on available data there is no consensus on whether Acacia
   should be subdivided. Sequence analysis of the chloroplast trnK intron,
   including the matK coding region and flanking noncoding regions,
   indicate that neither the tribe Acacieae nor the genus Acacia are
   monophyletic. Two subgenera are monophyletic: section Filicinae of
   subgenus Aculeiferum does not group with taxa of the subgenus. Section
   Filicinae, eight Ingeae genera, and Faidherbia form a weakly supported
   paraphyletic grade with respect to subg. Phyllodineae. Acacia subg.
   Aculeiferum (s. s.) is sister to the grade. These data suggest that
   characters currently used to differentiate taxa at the tribal, generic,

   DNA sequences, the trnL intron and trnL/trnF intergenic spacer. Included
   in this investigation are the genera of the Gnaphalieae from the African
   basal groups, members of the subtribes Cassiniinae, Gnaphaliinae, and
   Relhaniinae, and African representatives from the large Old World genus
   Helichrysum. Results indicate that two Gnaphaloid genera, Printzia and
   Callilepis, should be excluded from the Gnaphalieae. In most trees the
   Relhaniinae s.s. (sensu stricto) and some of the basal taxa comprise a
   clade that is sister to the remainder of the tribe Gnaphalieae. The
   Relhaniinae, which are restricted to Africa, are not a monophyletic
   group as presently circumscribed, nor are the South African members of
   Helichrysum, the Cassiniinae and Gnaphaliinae. There is general
   agreement between our molecular analysis and that of morphology,

AB Wide speculation surrounds the origin and phylogenetic relationships of
   the most highly reduced sections in the genus Carer. In order to gain a
   better understanding of phylogeny in Cares the relationship of the
   reduced sect. Phyllostachys to 12 putatively related sections,
   representing all four subgenera (Primocarex, Indocarex, Cares Vignea),
   was inferred from sequences of the ITS (internal transcribed spacer)
   region of nrDNA. Phylogenetic reconstructions identified two main
   clades: (1) a "compound" clade composed of sections from subg.
   Indocarex, Primocarex, and a portion of subg. Carer, and (2) a "reduced"
   clade consisting of sections from subg. Carer (Phyllostachys) and
   Primocarex (Filifoliae and Firmiculmes). Subgenus Indocarex was
   paraphyletic within the "compound" clade supporting classifications that
   have merged it within a wider subg. Indocarex/Carex/Primocarex line.
   Subgenus Primocarex was polyphyletic. This result was consistent with
   theories that extreme reduction has occurred along several different
   evolutionary lines in Carer. Phylogenetic theories inferred from the
   presence or abnormal growth of the rachilla were not supported by tree
   topologies. Difficult sectional circumscriptions, such as the separation
   of sections Laxiflorae and Careyanae, were strongly upheld by sequence
   data. The ITS region is an effective tool for defining sectional limits
   and for estimating relationships among sections in Carer, but does not
   provide enough phylogenetic information to fully resolve relationships
   below the sectional level.

AB Internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences of nuclear ribosomal DNA
   from 44 taxa of the genus Lupinus and five outgroup taxa were used for
   phylogenetic analysis. Lupinus appears as a strongly supported
   monophyletic genus, which is unambiguously part of the Genisteae. The
   lupines are distributed into five main clades in general accordance with
   their geographical origin. In the Old World, almost all the recognized
   taxonomic units are well resolved. The ITS data reveal an unexpectedly
   close relationship between the diverse sections Angustifoli and Lutei.
   The TTS results suggest a geographical division between the western New
   World lupines and the eastern ones. They also indicate the presence of
   some moderately to strongly supported groups of taxa, such as the
   Microcarpi-Pusilli group, the L. spariflorus-L. arizonicus group, the L.
   mexicanus-L. elegans group in the western New World, and the notable L.
   multiflorus-L. paraguariensis group in the eastern New World. The latter
   group strongly suggests that the eastern South American compound- and
   simple-leaved perennial lupines derive from a common ancestor. However.
   apart fi om some exceptions, relationships within the genus still remain
   largely unresolved based on ITS data. The lack of resolution at the base
   of the genus is suggestive of a rapid initial radiation of the lupines
   subsequent to the dispersal of their common ancestor. Relative rate
   tests demonstrate the presence of rate heterogeneity of ITS sequences
   within Lupinus. In marry pairwise comparisons between tars, substitution
   rate inequalities are correlated with the habit (annual, perennial),
   suggesting some role for the generation time effects in the evolutionary
   history of lupines.

AB Bromus hordeaceus (section Bromus, Poaceae), a predominantly
   self-fertilizing tetraploid (2n=28), is an annual weed native to the
   Mediterranean Basin, which now has a world-wide distribution. High
   morphological variation led to the recognition of four subspecies, three
   of which correlated with habitat-type. We examined genetic diversity at
   enzyme loci in 15 populations from the Mediterranean and the Atlantic
   region. Although sampled over a larger range of ecological and
   geographical conditions, the North-African populations appeared less
   genetically differentiated than populations from Brittany, suggesting
   higher levels of gene flow among the first ones (Nm = 3.756 and 1.066
   respectively). No genetic differentiation was encountered among the four
   subspecies. The populations were homozygous at homologous loci,
   suggesting high rates of selfing, but they frequently exhibited fixed
   intergenomic heterozygosity. The meiotic chromosome behaviour and
   disomic inheritance encountered are in accordance with the previously
   proposed allopolyploid origin of the species. The diploids B. arvensis
   and B. scoparius have been previously implicated in the parentage of B.
   hordeaceus on the basis of morphology and serology. We compared B.
   hordeaceus with related diploid species belonging to the same section
   (section Bromus) using different sources of data (flow cytometry,
   karyotypes, RAPD and DNA sequences). Molecular phylogeny based on
   internal transcribed spacer sequences of nuclear ribosomal genes
   provided the first clear scheme of relationships among monogenomic
   species of the section. A new hypothesis is proposed concerning the
   origin of B. hordeaceus: We found that it diverged earlier than all
   other species of section Bromus excluding the diploid B. caroli-henrici
   which is basal in this group. The 13 autapomorphies accumulated by B.
   hordeaceus, and the absence of intra-individual sequence heterogeneity
   are also consistent with the relatively ancient origin of the species
   within the section.

AB Petasites Mill. (Asteraceae: Senecioneae) is a taxonomically difficult
   genus of polygamodioecious, perennial herbs with a widespread
   distribution across North America. As many as 10 species and as few as
   two species (Petasites sagittatus (Banks ex Pursh) A. Gray and Petasites
   frigidus (L.) Fries with three varieties), with one hybrid taxon, have
   been recognized previously. Considerable taxonomic controversy has
   surrounded the genus as a result of a conservative floral morphology and
   a high degree of polymorphism in leaf morphology. Additionally, a number
   of intergrading leaf forms among those with rather consistent taxonomic
   characteristics across various treatments have contributed to the
   taxonomic ambivalence surrounding Petasites. Our taxonomic revision of
   North American Petasites is based on results obtained from recent
   multivariate morphometric and isozyme analyses. These data have
   indicated that taxa of Petasites are not sufficiently differentiated,
   morphologically or isozymically, from one another to warrant the
   recognition of separate species. Therefore, Petasites is circumscribed
   as a single species containing three varietal taxa and one hybrid taxon
   between two of the varieties. Although our circumscription of P.
   sagittatus is in accordance with most previous circumscriptions. we have
   removed it from the rank of species to varietal status under P.
   frigidus. The new combination Petasites frigidus var. sagittatus (Banks
   ex Pursh) Cherniawsky is proposed. Subsequent to the new status of one
   of its parental taxa (P. frigidus var. sagittatus), the new combination
   for Petasites xvitifolius (Greene) Bogle is proposed: Petasites frigidus
   var. xvitifolius (Greene) Cherniawsky. The three entities of the
   frigidus complex are united under one polymorphic taxon, P, frigidus
   var, frigidus and the circumscription and name of Petasites frigidus
   vat. palmatus (Ait.) Cronq, is in accordance with previous authors. A
   complete list of synonymy and a key to the taxa of Petasites is
   presented together with distribution maps.

AB The affinities as well as the circumscription of the Orthotrichaceae

   focus of a controversy for much of the last century. We obtained rbcL
   sequences for 37 arthrodontous mosses, including 27 taxa of the
   Orthotrichales. The sequences were analyzed using maximum parsimony and
   neighbor joining in order to (1) test the monophyly of the
   Orthotrichales and the Orthotrichaceae; (2) determine their phylogenetic
   relationships; and (3) test the current subfamilial classification
   within the Orthotrichaceae. Both analyses suggest that the
   Orthotrichales are polyphyletic. The Erpodiaceae and the
   Rhachitheciaceae as well as Amphidium and Drummondia, two genera of the
   Orthotrichaceae, are shown to be of haplolepideous affinity. The
   Splachnales, the Bryales sensu late, and the Orthotrichales form a
   monophyletic clade sister to the Haplolepideae. Both neighbor joining
   and maximum parsimony also suggest that the Orthotrichaceae are composed
   of two major lineages dominated either by acrocarpous or cladocarpous
   taxa. The monophyly of the family is, however, only well supported by
   Tamura's distances. The genera Macrocoma, Macromitrium, Orthotrichum,
   Ulota, and Zygodon all appear to be artificial assemblages. This study
   illustrates the contribution of rbcL sequence data to bryophyte
   systematics and, particularly, in determining the affinities of taxa
   lacking a peristome, whose characters are central to the classification
   of mosses.

AB Petasites Mill. (Asteraceae: Senecioneae) is a genus of diploid,
   perennial, clonal herbs with a widespread distribution across North
   America. Because of the low variability in floral morphology and high
   diversity in leaf morphology, considerable taxonomic confusion surrounds
   the genus. Petasites is generally recognized in North America by five
   ill-defined native taxa and two introduced species. Enzyme
   electrophoresis was conducted to assess the genetic variation in
   Petasites and obtain an understanding of the evolutionary relationships
   within the genus. Results show divergence at isozyme loci is not
   associated with morphological divergence. The mean number of alleles per
   locus and proportion of polymorphic loci are comparable with plants with
   similar life-history traits: however, levels of heterozygosity ranged
   substantially. Although there is a weak, negative association between
   geographical distance and genetic identity, this is not concordant with
   morphological differences. Typical of clonal species, genetic identities
   of Petasites are mon comparable with selfing plants than with other
   diploid, outcrossing perennials. Petasites also maintains a level of
   genetic diversity that is similar to other clonal plants and exhibits
   high levels of differentiation among its populations. This study
   provides the first contribution to the population genetic structure of
   Petasites. The relatively high values of genetic identities between the
   different taxa of Petasites and the similarity in isozymes and
   chromosome number indicates a rapid and recent origin in North America.
   These data, in accordance with the close morphological associations of
   the four taxa in Petasites, suggest the recognition of one species only,
   Petasites frigidus.

AB Asteraceae are the largest family of dicotyledonous plants and have long
   been known for their taxonomic complexity. The ubiquitous parallelisms
   in morphology within the family have made phylogenetic reconstruction
   and tribal circumscription an area of long debate. In this study we
   explored the utility of using two relatively short non-coding
   chloroplast DNA sequences, the trnL intron and trnL/trnF intergenic
   spacer, to resolve phylogenetic relationships among the tribes. The
   results of the phylogenetic analysis produced trees that are
   topologically congruent with prior phylogenetic hypotheses based on both
   morphological and molecular data sets. The Asteroideae are a
   monophyletic group, but the Cichorioideae are paraphyletic. The primary
   clades of the Cichorioideae are the Mutisieae-Cardueae,
   Liabeae-Vernonieae, and of the Asteroideae, the Inuleae-Plucheeae,
   Astereae-Anthemideae, Senecioneae-Gnaphalieae, and the helianthoid clade
   (Helenieae, Heliantheae s. str., and Eupatorieae). The Inuleae-Plucheeae
   clade is sister to the remainder of the Asteroideae, and the paraphyly
   of the Inuleae s.l. (Gnaphalieae, Inuleae s. str., and Plucheeae) is
   firmly supported by our analysis. Our study illustrates the utility of
   the trnL intron and trnL/F intergenic spacer for resolving relationships
   among tribes of the Asteraceae. Using approximately 874 bp, we were able
   to produce a phylogeny of comparable resolution to phylogenies based on
   well-known coding regions such as rbcL and ndhF. For phylogenetic
   inference at the family level the trnL intron and trnL/F spacer provide
   similar levels of resolution to longer coding sequences (e.g., rbcL,
   ndhF), while having the advantage of being much easier io amplify and
   sequence due to their short lengths and universal primers. The numerous
   insertions and deletions commonly found in this region are easily
   aligned and are phylogenetically informative, thus adding considerably
   to the information content per base pair sequenced.

AB Petasites Mill. (Asteraceae: Senecioneae) is a taxonomically difficult
   genus of polygamodioecious, perennial clonal herbs distributed across
   Canada, Alaska, and the northern contiguous United States. The taxonomic
   confusion surrounding the genus is reflected in the ambiguity of the
   various classification systems currently used. As many as ten species
   and as few as two species have been recognized (Petasites sagittatus
   (Banks ex Pursh) Gray and Petasites frigidurs (L.) Fries with three
   varieties), in addition to one hybrid taxon. To determine if discrete
   groups could be recognized according to a combination of vegetative and
   (or) reproductive characters and thereby clarify the phenetic
   relationships among the taxa of Petasites, morphological data were
   subjected to principal components and discriminant analyses. Particular
   emphasis was placed on P. frigidus var. frigidus, P. frigidus var.
   nivalis sensu Bogle, and the purported hybrid between these taxa, which
   exhibits an intermediate morphology (the frigidus complex).
   Additionally, the specific status of P. sagittatus was investigated.
   Evidence obtained from multivariate morphometric analyses indicates that
   North American Petasites is comprised of four closely related
   polymorphic entities. While morphological variation among different taxa
   of Pelasites is continuous for most reproductive characters, leaf
   characters were determined to be the most taxonomically discriminating.
   The entities of the frigidus complex form a cohesive group somewhat
   distinct from the other taxa. The morphological differentiation between
   P. sagittatus and other taxa of Petasites is not considered sufficient
   to warrant recognition of specific status. Therefore, we recommend that
   only one polymorphic species of Petasites in North America be recognized
   (P. frigidus with three varieties) in addition to one hybrid taxon
   originating from a cross between two of the varieties.

AB The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of nuclear ribosomal DNA
   from 22 diploid and tetraploid annual Bromus species of section Bromus
   (Poaceae) and three species belonging to other Bromus sections, Bromus
   catharticus (section Ceratochloa), Bromus anomalus (section Pnigma), and
   Bromus sterilis (section Genea), were investigated by PCR amplification
   and direct sequencing. The length of the ITS-1 region varied from 215 to
   218 bp, and that of the ITS-2 region from 215 to 216 bp, in the species
   analyzed. ITS-1 was more variable and provided more informative sites
   (49) than ITS-2 (32). No variation was encountered within species. In
   pairwise comparison among species of section Bromus, sequence divergence
   ranged from 0.0 to 8.0% for the combined ITS-1 and ITS-2 regions.
   Parsimony analysis using Avena longiglumis and Hordeum vulgare as
   outgroups resulted in well-resolved phylogenetic trees and showed that
   section Bromus is monophyletic according to the species analyzed outside
   of the section. The analysis clarified the phylogenetic relationships
   among monogenomic (diploid) species. Introduction of the allotetraploid
   species did not change the general topology of the trees obtained using
   only the diploid species. Although some tetraploid-diploid species
   relationships will have to be clarified with faster evolving markers,
   the ITS sequences are shown to be useful for assessing evolutionary
   relationships among closely related Bromus species, as well as for
   clarifying taxonomic problems in previously controversial cases (e.g.,
   Bromus alopecuros and Bromus caroli-henrici). New hypotheses are
   proposed concerning the origin of several allotetraploid species. For
   example, it is shown that the tetraploid Bromus hordeaceus diverged
   earlier than all other species of section Bromus, excluding the diploid
   B. caroli-henrici, which is found to be basal in this group. The
   tetraploid Bromus arenarius, which was considered a hybrid between
   sections Bromus and Genea, and the tetraploid Bromus adoensis are sister
   taxa within section Bromus; they belong in a weakly differentiated clade
   with the diploids Bromus brachystachys, Bromus japonicus, Bromus
   squarrosus, Bromus arvensis, and Bromus intermedius.

AB The ''one fungus-two photomorphs'' hypothesis suggests that certain
   lichenized fungi can establish a symbiotic relationship with either a
   eukaryotic or a prokaryotic photobiont. Such pairs of photomorphs are
   well know from cephalodiate Peltigerineae. Using an ascomycete-specific
   primer we amplified the internal transcribed spacer region of the nrDNA
   repeat of the mycobiont from total ''lichen DNA'' extracts of Peltigera
   malacea, photomorphs of P. aphthosa, P. britannica, and P. leucophlebia,
   Nephroma expallidum, and photomorphs of N. arcticum. Comparisons of 5.8S
   sequences suggest that the sequences obtained belong to the mycobiont
   and thus, that the ascomycete-specific primer is adequate for amplifying
   fungal DNA from total lichen-DNA extracts. The strict identity of
   nucleotide sequences of the internal transcribed spacer region of the
   nrDNA repeat between joined-photomorphs supports the one fungus-two
   photomorphs hypothesis. Photomorphs may thus primarily reflect
   phenotypic plasticity of photomorphic fungi in response to changing
   environmental conditions. The cyanomorph recently reported for P.
   leucophlebia is shown to be based on a misidentified specimen of P.
   aphthosa. Comparisons of the ITS sequences further supports recognizing
   P. aphthosa, P. britannica, and P. leucophlebia at the species rather
   than the infraspecific level. (C) 1997 Academic Press.

AB Antennaria (Asteraceae: Gnaphalieae) is useful as a tool for studying
   polyploid agamic complexes because both polyploidy and agamospermy are
   widespread in this genus. They are dioecious, perennial herbs that occur
   throughout temperate and arctic regions of the northern hemisphere, with
   the major center of diversity in the Rocky Mountains of North America.
   The diploids are morphologically well-defined and usually have rather
   restricted geographic ranges. The five polyploid complexes in the genus
   differ considerably from one another with respect to ploidy levels,
   morphological variation and reproductive modes. The triploid/tetraploid
   gametophytic apomict, A. rosea, is one of the most thoroughly examined
   complexes in the genus and it is used to illustrate the evolution of a
   typical Antennaria polyploid agamic complex The A. rosea polyploid
   complex has a wider geographic range and possibly greater ecological
   amplitude than its diploid progenitors and is the result of multiple
   hybrid origin from among as many as eight sexual diploid species. The
   diploids gave rise to A. rosea through the processes of interspecific
   hybridization and backcrossing among themselves and probably through
   hybridization with facultatively sexual apomicts. The agamic complexes,
   including A. rosea, may be morphologically confluent with one another
   because they share sexual progenitors.

AB As part of an analysis of genetic diversity in endemic taxa of the

   was examined by starch gel electrophoresis in six populations of the
   endemic Achillea millefolium ssp. megacephala, and 13 populations of the
   closely related widespread taxon, A. millefolium ssp. lanulosa. Endemic
   populations had more alleles per locus, a higher percentage of
   polymorphic loci, and greater genetic diversity than did populations of
   the widespread taxon. At polymorphic loci, total gene diversity was
   comparable in both taxa, although within-population gene diversity was
   higher in the endemic taxon. Population differentiation (G(ST)) was
   considerably lower in ssp. megacephala than in ssp. lanulosa, although
   G(ST) values were reduced when the parameter was calculated separately
   for geographic subdivisions of the widespread taxon. Our results differ
   from previous studies in which the endemic is typically depauperate of
   genetic variation relative to related widespread species. We suggest
   that obligate sexual reproduction and the absence of long-term asexual
   reproduction may be one of a number of factors that help populations of
   ssp. megacephala maintain higher levels of genetic variation on the
   Athabasca sand dunes.

AB The phylogenetic relationships among sexually reproducing species of
   Antennaria (Asteraceae) are poorly understood. An earlier cladistic
   analysis based on morphology did not fully resolve the phylogeny of
   these taxa and therefore a different approach using molecular data was
   explored. The internal transcribed spacer regions (ITS-1 and ITS-2) of
   nuclear ribosomal DNA were sequenced for 30 species of Antennaria and
   one species from each of the outgroup genera Anaphalis, Ewartia,
   Leontopodium and Pseudognaphalium. The ITS-1 sequence in Antennaria
   ranged from 253 to 260 base pairs (bp) in length, and the proportion of
   nucleotide differences between pairs of species of Antennaria ranged
   from 1 to 14%. For ITS-2, the divergence between pairs of species of
   Antennaria ranged from 0 to 8%. ITS-2 is shorter than ITS-1, ranging
   from 213 to 219 bp. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that, relative to
   the outgroups included, Antennaria is a well-supported monophyletic
   group. Based on the genera surveyed, Leontopodium appears to be the
   sister genus of Antennaria. The general topology of the molecular trees
   agrees with that based on previous morphological analyses and indicates
   that Antennaria is composed of six clades of equal rank corresponding to
   the traditionally recognized informal groups, the Geyerine, Argenteae,
   Arcuatae, Dimorphae, Pulcherrimae, and Catipes. Sequence and
   morphological data indicate that the Alpinae and Dioicae are unnatural,
   polyphyletic units that should be abandoned and redefined as the
   monophyletic Catipes group. Phylogenetic analysis of ITS sequences also
   suggests the dissociation of A. stenophylla from the Dimorphae, where it
   is traditionally placed, and its affiliation with the Argenteae, as well
   as the placement of A. arcuata in its own group.

AB Sarraceniaceae, a New World family of carnivorous plants, consist of

   extensive interest in these plants, few explicit phylogenetic hypotheses
   are available for the family. We investigate phylogenetic relationships
   in the family using sequences of the internal transcribed spacer regions
   of nuclear ribosomal DNA (ITS) and of the chloroplast gene rbcL. One
   representative of each genus was sequenced for rbcL, whereas
   representatives of all species in the family, except for H. heterodoxa
   and H. ionasii, were sequenced for ITS. Both the ITS- and rbcl-based
   phylogenies demonstrate that Sarracenia and Heliamphora form a
   monophyletic group that is the sister group of Darlingtonia. Sarracenia
   and Heliamphora are each well supported monophyletic genera. In our
   restricted sampling of Heliamphora, H. nutans is the sister of H. minor
   and H. tatei. Our results provide little resolution of relationships
   among species of Sarracenia, but identify one dade that consists of all
   species except S. alata. Within this clade are two smaller clades
   comprising:-1) S. purpurea and S. leucophylla,-and-2) S. flava, S.
