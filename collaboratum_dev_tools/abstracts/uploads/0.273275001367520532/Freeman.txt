AB The development of refractoriness to the short-day melatonin rhythm in
   mid-winter triggers recrudescence of the photoinhibited reproductive
   system of many rodents. As a result, over-wintering animals attain
   reproductive competence prior to the onset of spring conditions that
   favor successful reproduction. While in the photorefractory state,
   hamsters are insensitive to short day lengths and the associated
   long-duration melatonin rhythm. Prior to regaining sensitivity to short
   day length inhibition of reproduction, hamsters must first be exposed to
   10 to 12 weeks of long, summer-like day lengths and the associated
   short-duration melatonin rhythm. The neural melatonin target tissues
   that mediate the breaking of photorefractoriness by long day lengths
   have not been identified. Long day length information is thought to be
   communicated to the reproductive axis through the actions of melatonin
   at the reuniens nucleus of the thalamus (NRe) and the SCN of the
   hypothalamus. The authors report that the SCN and the NRe also
   participate in the breaking of reproductive photorefractoriness by long
   day lengths. Micro-implants of melatonin that were left in place for 12
   weeks during exposure to long day lengths and that act locally on these
   brain nuclei to obscure the endogenous melatonin rhythm, and thus
   ambient day length information, blocked the breaking of refractoriness.
   Identical melatonin implants located in another melatonin target tissue,
   the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus, did not interfere with the
   breaking of reproductive refractoriness. By contrast, breaking of
   refractoriness of the seasonal body mass response did not follow the
   pattern exhibited by the reproductive response. The results suggest that
   these melatonin target tissues serve distinct but overlapping roles in
   the photoperiodic mechanism.

AB Testosterone or its metabolite, estrogen, regulates aggression in males
   of many mammalian species. Because plasma testosterone levels are
   typically positively correlated with both aggression and reproduction,
   aggression is expected to be higher when males are in reproductive
   condition. However, in some photoperiodic species such as Siberian
   hamsters (Phodopus sungorus), males are significantly more aggressive in
   short day lengths when the testes are regressed and circulating
   testosterone concentrations are reduced. These results led to the
   formation of the hypothesis that aggression is modulated independently
   of circulating steroids in Siberian hamsters. Thus, recent studies have
   been designed to characterize the role of other neuroendocrine factors
   in modulating aggression. However, aggression may be mediated by
   testosterone or estrogen despite basal concentrations of these steroids
   by increasing sensitivity to steroids in specific brain regions.
   Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that males housed under short
   days have increased expression of estrogen receptor a in the bed nucleus
   of the stria terminalis, medial amygdala, and central amygdala. Neural
   activation in response to an aggressive encounter was also examined
   across photoperiod. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In common with reproduction, immune function exhibits strong seasonal
   patterns, which are driven by annual changes in day length (photoperiod)
   and melatonin secretion. Whereas changes in melatonin communicate
   seasonal time into the reproductive axis via subcortical receptors, the
   relevant melatonin targets for communicating seasonal time into the
   immune system remain unspecified. The authors report that melatonin
   implants targeting the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) induced
   a winter phenotype in the immune system. SCN melatonin implants
   attenuated infection-induced anorexia and cachexia, indicating that the
   SCN mediate the effects of melatonin on these behavioral and metabolic
   symptoms of infection. However, SCN melatonin implants failed to induce
   winter-like peripheral leukocyte concentrations or behavioral
   thermoregulatory responses to infection. In contrast, subcutaneous
   melatonin implants induced winter-like changes in all behavioral and
   immunological parameters. Melatonin acts directly at the SCN to induce
   seasonal changes in neural-immune systems that regulate behavior. The
   data identify anatomical overlap between neural substrates mediating the
   effects of melatonin on the reproductive and immune systems but also
   suggest that the SCN are not the sole mediator of photoperiodic effects
   of melatonin on immunity.

AB Siberian hamsters (Phodopus sungorus) exhibit seasonal cycles of
   reproduction driven by changes in day length. Day length is encoded
   endogenously by the duration of nocturnal melatonin (Mel) secretion from
   the pineal gland. Short-duration Mel signals stimulate reproduction and
   long-duration signals inhibit reproduction. The mechanism by which Mel
   signals are decoded at the level of neural target tissues remains
   uncharacterized. In Siberian hamsters, exposure to short day lengths or
   injections of Mel in long days results in a decrease in hypothalamic
   expression of type 2 iodothyronine deiodinase (Dio2) mRNA. Dio2
   catalyzes the conversion of the thyroid hormone thyroxine to
   triiodothyronine (T-3). Thus exposure to short and long day lengths
   should decrease and increase hypothalamic T-3 concentrations,
   respectively. We tested the hypothesis that exogenous T-3 administered
   to short-day hamsters would mimic exposure to long day lengths with
   respect to gonadal stimulation. Hamsters gestated and raised in short
   day lengths that exhibited photoinhibition of the testes were given
   daily subutaneous injections of T-3 or saline vehicle for 4 wk beginning
   at week 12 of life. The results indicate that exogenous T-3 induced
   gonadal growth in short-day hamsters and delayed spontaneous gonadal
   development by an interval equal to the number of weeks during which T-3
   was administered. T-3 injections delayed gonadal regression if given
   coincident with the transfer of hamsters from long to short day lengths.
   These results suggest that T-3 Mimics long day exposure in Siberian
   hamsters and may serve as an intermediate step between the Mel rhythm
   and the reproductive response.

AB With Europe at a crossroads, facing both nationalism and globalism,
   Nietzsche has some interesting things to say about our world today.
   Nietzsche's holism is multifaceted and complex, thus, he has attracted
   many critics. Recent scholarship has interpreted his holism as an
   offence to modern liberal society. Some have claimed that Nietzsche's
   "perspectivism" and the "overcoming of morality," two essential
   categories of his holism, are essentially expressions of democratic
   ideals of tolerance. Still others have argued that Nietzsche's 'will to
   power' is to be understood as an expression of freedom where human
   bondage and prejudice are cast aside in the name of some brand of
   neo-Kantian liberalism. And finally, there are those voices who continue
   to paint Nietzsche's holism as nothing more than savage realism and
   harsh criticism. In this essay, I examine many of these claims (focusing
   principally on 'the will to power') with the expectation of trying to
   discern the value of his holism for advancing a paradigm for
   integration. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The role of the intergeniculate leaflet of the thalamus (IGL) in
   photoperiod responsiveness was examined in a laboratory-selected line of
   photoperiod nonresponsive (NR) Siberian hamsters. NR hamsters fail to
   exhibit typical winter-type responses (i.e., gonadal regression and
   development of winter-type pelage) when exposed to short day lengths
   (e.g., 10 h of light/day). Earlier studies revealed that NR hamsters
   will exhibit winter-type responses when exposed to short photoperiod if
   they are given free access to a running wheel. The present study tested
   the hypothesis that this locomotor activity-induced reversal of
   phenotype is dependent on the IGL. Male NR hamsters underwent
   destruction of the IGL prior to being housed in short day lengths in
   cages equipped with running wheels. Activity rhythms were monitored for
   8 weeks, after which time pelage response and paired testes weights were
   obtained. In contrast to sham-operated NR animals given access to
   running wheels, IGL-ablated animals showed no increase in the duration
   of nocturnal running wheel activity and became active later in the night
   than sham-lesioned animals. Lesioned animals also failed to exhibit the
   typical short photoperiod-induced gonadal regression and pelage molt.
   The results implicate the IGL in the mechanism by which running wheel
   activity can influence photoperiodic responses.

AB Intracerebroventricular (ICV) injections of neuropeptide Y (NPY) are
   known to decrease body temperature (T-b) of laboratory rats by 1-3
   degrees C. Several NPY pathways in the brain terminate in hypothalamic
   structures involved in energy balance and thermoregulation. Laboratory
   rats are homeothermic, maintaining Tb within a narrow range. We examined
   the effect of ICV injected NPY on Tb in the heterothermic Siberian
   hamster (Phodopus sungorus), a species that naturally undergoes daily
   torpor in which Tb decreases by as much as 15-20 degrees C. Minimum
   effective dose was determined in preliminary testing then various doses
   of NPY were tested in cold-acclimated Siberian hamsters while food was
   withheld. NPY markedly reduced Tb in the heterothermic Siberian hamster.
   In addition, the reduction in T-b in 63% of the observations was
   sufficient to reach the criterion for daily torpor (T-b < 32 degrees C
   for at least 30 min). Neither the incidence of torpor nor its depth or
   duration was related to NPY dose. Both likelihood and magnitude of
   response varied within animals on different test days. NPY decreased
   24-h food intake and this was exaggerated in the animals reaching
   criterion for torpor; the decrease in food intake was positively
   correlated with the magnitude of the decrease in Tb. The mild
   hypothermia seen in homeothermic laboratory rats after NPY injected ICV
   is exaggerated, often greatly, in the heterothermic Siberian hamster.
   NPY treatment may be activating hypothalamic systems that normally
   integrate endogenous torpor-producing signals and initiate torpor. (c)

AB Siberian hamsters are seasonal breeders that use changes in day length
   to synchronize their reproductive effort with those times of the year
   most favorable for successful reproduction. The ability of Siberian
   hamsters to measure and respond to changes in day length depends upon
   accurate photoentrainment of the circadian clock in the suprachiasmatic
   nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus. Two pathways have been characterized
   through which entraining stimuli reach the SCN: the retinohypothalamic
   tract (RHT), which transmits light information from the retinae, and the
   getriculohypothalamic tract (GHT) from the intergetriculate leaflet of
   the thalamus (IGL), which is involved in transmitting both photic and
   nonphotic cues. Ablating the IGL-GHT results in only modest alterations
   in entrainment to static day lengths and fails to interfere with
   seasonal responses induced by transfer from static long day to static
   short day lengths. Because several studies suggest that the IGL may be
   involved in tracking the time of dusk and dawn, we sought to determine
   whether an intact IGL is necessary for hamsters to respond to a
   simulated natural photoperiod (SNP) in which the time of dusk and dawn
   gradually changes in a pattern approximating the rate of change in day
   length that occurs during autumn at the latitude this species inhabits
   in nature. The results indicate that neurochemical lesions of the IGL
   alter both the pattern of circadian entrainment and photoperiodic
   responsiveness of Siberian hamsters to an SNP. Both intact and
   IGL-lesioned hamsters exhibited testicular regression in shortening day
   lengths, but only IGL-intact hamsters exhibited seasonal pelage molt.

AB Assessment of seasonal variations in expression of brain neuropeptide
   mRNA is complicated by concurrent circadian variations. Because
   entrainment of suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) based rhythms differs in
   long versus short day lengths, valid seasonal comparisons must be made
   at equivalent circadian phases. We used a novel experimental design
   which permitted sampling at identical circadian phases of animals
   exhibiting opposite seasonal reproductive responses to the same
   intermediate day length. This allowed us to test whether seasonal
   changes in arginine vasopressin (AVP) and vasoactive intestinal peptide
   (VIP) mRNA expression in the SCN occur in the absence of the pineal
   gland. Juvenile Siberian hamsters were gestated and maintained
   postnatally in either a long photoperiod (16 h light/day) or short
   photoperiod (10 h light/day). At the time of weaning (18 days of age),
   the hamsters were pinealectomized and either transferred to a new
   photoperiod (10-, 16- or 14-h light/day) or left in the original
   photoperiod. Hamsters from 10L had substantially smaller and lighter
   testes than those from 16L. If photoperiodic modulation of AVP and VIP
   mRNA expression occurs in the absence of the pineal, then transfer of
   pinealectomized hamsters from a longer (16L) or shorter (10L)
   photoperiod to an intermediate photoperiod (14L) should result in a
   differential response with respect to SCN AVP and VIP mRNA expression
   but not testis size. When sampled at an identical circadian phase (3 h
   after lights on) in 14L there was no difference in the expression of AVP
   or VIP mRNA in the SCN between animals previously housed in long versus
   short day lengths. In contrast to a previous study that did not
   carefully control for circadian phase, the present findings suggest that
   seasonal photoperiodic control of SCN neuropeptide mRNA expression
   depends upon the pineal gland. In addition, the present findings
   demonstrate a significant, negative correlation between AVP mRNA
   expression in the SCN and the length of the daily active phase (alpha).

AB Golden-mantled ground squirrels (Spermophilus lateralis) undergo
   seasonal hibernation during which core body temperature (T-b) values are
   maintained 1-2degrees C above ambient temperature. Hibernation is not
   continuous. Squirrels arouse at similar to7-day intervals, during which
   T-b increases to 37degrees C for similar to16 h; thereafter, they return
   to hibernation and sustain low T(b)s until the next arousal. Over the
   course of the hibernation season, arousals consume 60-80% of a
   squirrel's winter energy budget, but their functional significance is
   unknown and disputed. Host-defense mechanisms appear to be downregulated
   during the hibernation season and preclude normal immune responses.
   These experiments assessed immune function during hibernation and
   subsequent periodic arousals. The acute-phase response to bacterial
   lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was arrested during hibernation and fully
   restored on arousal to normothermia. LPS injection (ip) resulted in a
   1-1.5degrees C fever in normothermic animals that was sustained for >8
   h. LPS was without effect in hibernating squirrels, neither inducing
   fever nor provoking arousal, but a fever did develop several days later,
   when squirrels next aroused from hibernation; the duration of this
   arousal was increased sixfold above baseline values.
   Intracerebroventricular infusions of prostaglandin E-2 provoked arousal
   from hibernation and induced fever, suggesting that neural signaling
   pathways that mediate febrile responses are functional during
   hibernation. Periodic arousals may activate a dormant immune system,
   which can then combat pathogens that may have been introduced
   immediately before or during hibernation.

AB The mid-winter development of refractoriness to melatonin (Mel) triggers
   recrudescence of the atrophied reproductive apparatus of rodents. As a
   consequence, over-wintering animals with the independent regulation by
   day length of the several behavioral and physiological traits that vary
   seasonally in mammals, become reproductively competent just before the
   onset of spring conditions favorable for breeding. The neural target
   tissues that cease to respond to winter Mel signals have not been
   identified. We now report that the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the
   hypothalamus, which contains the principal circadian clock, and the
   reuniens and paraventricular nuclei of the thalamus, each independently
   becomes refractory to melatonin, Small implants of Mel that were left in
   place for 40 wk and that act locally on these brain nuclei, induced
   testicular regression within 6 wk in male Siberian hamsters; 12 wk later
   Mel implants no longer suppressed reproduction and gonadal recrudescence
   ensued, Hamsters that were then given a systemic Mel infusion s.c.
   immediately initiated a second gonadal regression, implying that neurons
   at each site become refractory to Mel without compromising
   responsiveness of other Mel target tissues. Refractoriness occurs
   locally and independently at each neural target tissue, rather than in a
   separate "refractoriness" substrate. Restricted, target-specific actions
   of Mel are consistent with the independent regulation by day length of
   the several behavioral and physiological traits that vary seasonally in
   mammals.

AB Exposure to low ambient temperatures (T-a) accelerates appearance of the
   winter phenotype in Siberian hamsters transferred from long to short day
   lengths. Because melatonin transduces the effects of day length on the
   neuroendocrine axis, the authors assessed whether low T-a promotes the
   transition to winterlike traits by accelerating the onset of increased
   nocturnal melatonin secretion or by enhancing responsiveness to
   melatonin in short day lengths. Male hamsters were transferred from 16L
   (16 h light/day) to 8L (8 h light/day) photoperiods and held at 5
   degreesC or 22 degreesC. Locomotor activity was recorded continuously,
   and body mass, testis size, and pelage color were determined biweekly
   for 8 weeks. The duration of nocturnal locomotion (alpha), a reliable
   indicator of the duration of nocturnal melatonin secretion, lengthened
   significantly earlier in hamsters exposed to a T-a of 5 degreesC than 22
   degreesC. Cold exposure increased the proportion of hamsters that were
   photoresponsive: gonadal regression in short days increased from 44% at
   22 degreesC to 81% at 5 degreesC (p < 0.05); low T-a did not, however,
   accelerate testicular regression in animals that were photoresponsive.
   Nonphotoresponsive animals at 5 <degrees>C temporarily had longer alphas
   during the first 4 weeks in short days and significant decreases in body
   mass and testicular size that were reversed during the ensuing weeks
   when a decreased. In a 2nd experiment, pinealectomized male hamsters
   infused for 10 h/day with melatonin for 2 weeks had significantly lower
   body and testes masses when maintained at 5 degreesC but not 22
   degreesC. Low-ambient temperature appears to accelerate the appearance
   of the winter phenotype primarily by increasing target tissue

AB We investigated the impact of frequency and pattern of melatonin signals
   on reproductive development in Siberian hamsters. Juvenile males
   gestated in short day lengths and housed in constant illumination to
   suppress melatonin secretion were infused with melatonin for 5 h either
   once or twice per day for 20 days. Melatonin infusions at either
   frequency produced equivalent increases in testes and body weights that
   exceeded those of animals infused with saline but were indistinguishable
   from those of hamsters transferred to long day lengths. The reproductive
   system appears to be maximally stimulated by a single short melatonin
   signal each day. Other animals kept from birth in a short photoperiod
   were treated 6 h after onset of darkness with the beta-adrenergic
   receptor antagonist DL-propranolol to shorten melatonin secretion on the
   night of injection but not on subsequent nights. This permitted
   interpolation of short nightly melatonin signals of 4-5 h duration
   against a background of long melatonin signals of 10-12 h duration on
   other nights. Treatment regimes that maintained a 1:1 ratio of short to
   long melatonin signals for 8 wk stimulated reproductive development; a
   1:2 signal ratio, in each of three different patterns, was uniformly
   ineffective. The number of successive short melatonin signals had little
   influence on the interval across which successive melatonin signals were
   summated to influence photoperiodic traits. The neuroendocrine axis
   appears more responsive to short melatonin signal frequency than pattern
   for development of the summer phenotype.

AB In golden-mantled ground squirrels, phase angles of entrainment of
   circadian locomotor activity to a fixed light-dark cycle differ markedly
   between subjective summer and winter, A change in ambient temperature
   affects entrainment only during subjective winter when it also produces
   pronounced effects on body temperature (T-b). It was previously proposed
   that variations in T-b are causally related to the circannual rhythm in
   circadian entrainment. To test this hypothesis, wheel-running activity
   and T-b were monitored for 12 to 14 months in castrated male ground
   squirrels housed in a 14:10 LD photocycle at 21 degrees C. Animals were
   treated with testosterone implants that eliminated hibernation and
   prevented the marked winter decline in T-b; these squirrels manifested
   circannual changes in circadian entrainment indistinguishable from those
   of untreated animals. Both groups exhibited pronounced changes in phase
   angle and alpha of circadian wheel-running and T-b rhythms. Seasonal
   variation in T-b is not necessary for circannual changes in circadian
   organization of golden-mantled ground squirrels.

AB The pineal hormone melatonin influences circadian rhythms and also
   mediates reproductive responses to photoperiod. The authors tested
   whether pinealectomy influences circadian oscillators responsible for
   induction of nonresponsiveness to short day lengths by preventing normal
   short-day patterns of circadian entrainment. Adult male Siberian
   hamsters were pinealectomized or sham operated, maintained in either 18
   h light per day (18L) or 15L for 10 weeks, and then tested for
   responsiveness to 10L. Because pinealectomized hamsters do not show
   gonadal regression in short day lengths, responsiveness was assessed by
   measuring phase angle of entrainment and the length of the nightly
   activity period following transfer to 10L. The incidence of
   nonresponsiveness was significantly higher in 18L hamsters than in 15L
   hamsters but was unaffected by pineal status. Fully 88% of 18L hamsters
   failed to entrain to 10L in the normal short-day manner; the duration of
   nightly activity remained compressed, and the phase angle of entrainment
   was large and negative relative to lights off. The 15L hamsters
   entrained normally to 10L. Exposure to constant Light after 10L
   treatment was equally effective in inducing arrhythmicity in
   pinealectomized and intact hamsters. Changes in the period of morning
   and evening circadian oscillators subsequent to 18L treatment did not
   predict circadian responsiveness to short photoperiod. Long-day
   induction of photo-nonresponsiveness, which prevents winter responses to
   short day lengths, occurs independently of pineal melatonin feedback on
   the circadian system.

AB Juvenile male Siberian hamsters from a line of hamsters selected for
   nonresponsiveness to short photoperiod (PNRj) and animals from the
   general colony (UNS) were separated at weaning into two groups. Group 1
   males were moved into short days (10 h light:14 h dark [10L:14D]) with
   free access to running wheels (RW). Group 2 animals were the male
   siblings of Group 1 hamsters; they were moved at the same time into the
   same room, but were housed in cages without access to RW. Group 2
   hamsters only had access to RW for the final week of short-day exposure
   (Week 8). Animals were blood sampled at the time of sacrifice for
   analysis of serum prolactin (PRL) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)
   concentrations. At sacrifice, paired testis weights were obtained and
   pelage color was scored. Animals from the UNS line showed the expected
   declines in testis weight, body weight, and serum concentrations of both
   PRL and FSH, regardless of the presence or absence of RW. These animals
   also exhibited a high proportion of individuals molting to winter-type
   pelage. By contrast, a marked difference was noted between siblings from
   the PNRj line depending on whether RW access was provided at the time of
   weaning. Animals with access to RW exhibited identical responses to
   those of the UNS responder animals, whereas PNRj animals without access
   to RW showed no adjustments to short days (i.e., testis regression,
   pelage molt, expansion of alpha). In a second experiment, PNRj and UNS
   males were placed in constant darkness (DD), with or without RW access.
   The results of this experiment indicated that PNRj animals respond to DD
   regardless of the presence or absence of RW. In DD, PNRj hamsters also
   exhibited significantly longer free-running period lengths (taus) than
   did UNS hamsters; all the PNRj hamsters had taus > 24 h, whereas none of
   the UNS hamsters had a tau > 24 h. These results indicate that PNRj
   hamsters retain the proper neural pathways for responding to short day
   lengths and establish a role for locomotor activity feedback in
   modulating the circadian system and, subsequently, photoperiodic
   responsiveness in PNRj hamsters.

AB Groups from three different breeding lines of Siberian hamsters (UNS =
   general colony animals, PNRa = selected for photoperiod
   nonresponsiveness as adults, PNRj = selected for photoperiod
   nonresponsiveness as juveniles) were exposed to short days at weaning
   and again as adults (Experiment 1) or only as adults (Experiment 2). The
   proportion of photoperiod nonresponsive individuals in each line was
   determined by measuring testis length after 6 weeks of exposure to short
   days (juveniles) or by paired testis weights after 12 weeks in short
   photoperiod (adults). Adults were blood sampled on the day of sacrifice
   (Experiment 1) or on Weeks 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, and 12 (Experiment 2) for
   determination of serum prolactin (PRL) and follicle-stimulating hormone
   (FSH) concentrations. Nonresponsive individuals were present in all
   three lines of hamsters. Furthermore, all three lines of hamsters showed
   an increase in the proportion of nonresponders with age; some
   individuals are responsive to short days as juveniles, but become
   nonresponsive in adulthood. The two PNR lines exhibited a greater
   proportion of nonresponders at both ages compared to the UNS line, with
   the PNRj line exhibiting the greatest proportion of nonresponders at
   each age. During exposure to short days, nonresponders exhibited
   significantly higher serum PRL and FSH concentrations than did the UNS
   line; nonresponders also exhibited larger testis size, and fewer animals
   molted to winter-type pelage, The results indicate that (a) in all three
   lines, a significantly higher proportion of animals are nonresponsive to
   short photoperiod as adults than as juveniles; (b) selection for
   nonresponsiveness as juveniles can produce a line of hamsters that, as
   adults, are nearly all nonresponsive to short days; and (c) some
   individuals from each line are responsive to short photoperiod early in
   life, but become nonresponsive as adults.

AB In studies of photoperiodism, animals typically are transferred abruptly
   from a long (e.g., 16 h light per day [16L]) to a short (8L)
   photoperiod, and circadian oscillators that regulate pineal melatonin
   secretion are presumed to reentrain rapidly to the new photocycle. Among
   rats and Siberian hamsters, however, reentrainment rates vary depending
   on whether additional darkness is added to morning or evening, and a
   subset of hamsters (nonresponders) fails ever to reentrain normally to
   short photoperiods. The authors assessed whether several short-day
   responses occurred at different rates when darkness was extended into
   morning versus evening hours and the effectiveness of abrupt versus
   gradual shortening in day lengths (DLs). Entrainment patterns of
   photoresponsive hamsters also were compared to those of
   photononresponsive hamsters. Responsive hamsters transferred on a single
   day from 16L to 8L underwent more rapid gonadal regression, weight loss,
   decreases in follicle-stimulating hormone titers, and expansion of
   nocturnal locomotor activity when darkness was added to morning versus
   evening. When the dark phase was extended gradually by 8 h over 16
   weeks, short-day responses occurred at the same rate whether darkness
   was appended to morning or evening or was added symmetrically. Darkness
   added to evening promoted more rapid short-day responses when it was
   added gradually rather than abruptly, despite the fact that average DLs
   were significantly shorter for the latter group. Among nonresponders,
   morning extensions of darkness transiently increased activity duration,
   whereas evening extensions did not. Gradual and abrupt decreases in DL
   differentially affect entrainment of evening and morning circadian
   oscillators. The authors argue for the incorporation of simulated
   natural photoperiods in studies of photoperiodism.

TI ROLE OF GONADAL-STEROIDS AND INHIBITORY PHOTOPERIOD IN REGULATING

AB We investigated the role of declining daylength and gonadal steroids on
   body weight and food intake in male deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus).
   This species was chosen for study because individual males display
   different reproductive responses to inhibitory daylength. About
   one-third of all mice exposed to short days undergo testicular
   regression and exhibit reduced circulating levels of luteinizing hormone
   and testosterone (reproductive responsive males). In contrast,
   testicular function and circulating levels of both these hormones remain
   unaffected in an equal number of mice (reproductive nonresponsive
   males). Previous studies have shown that each phenotype exhibits a
   distinct set of metabolic responses to short days, including adjustments
   in body weight. These characteristics make deer mice a useful animal
   model in which to study the interactive effects of gonadal steroids and
   photoperiod on neural substrates regulating body weight. A
   gonadectomy/steroid replacement experimental model was used to test the
   role of testosterone in regulating body weight and food intake in short
   day-housed male deer mice. Among gonad-intact males, short daylength
   caused a decline in body weight in both reproductive responsive and
   nonresponsive individuals. However, reproductive responsive mice lost
   significantly more body weight than did nonresponsive mice. Furthermore,
   while the weight loss was accompanied by a significant reduction in food
   intake in responsive mice, the relatively minor weight loss in
   nonresponsive mice was not accompanied by a change in food intake.
   Because changes in body weight and food intake (data not shown) occurred
   nearly simultaneously during the 8-week exposure to short daylength,
   results suggest that modifications in body weight are not responsible
   for the decline in food consumed, and vice versa. Gonadectomized
   reproductive responsive mice lost the same amount of weight as intact
   responsive mice but ate significantly more food. Among nonresponsive
   males, gonadectomy led to significantly greater weight loss, relative to
   intact mice, but caused an increase in food intake per gram body weight.
   Steroid replacement prevented weight loss and increased food intake in
   both gonadal phenotypes. Despite the observations that food intake was
   steroid dependent and the magnitude of the effect differed between
   reproductive phenotypes, changes in food consumption do not fully
   explain the inhibitory effects of short days on body weight in either
   phenotype. Taken together with previous studies, these results suggest
   that reproductive quiescence confers significant metabolic benefits to
   individual deer mice by reducing the amount of daily energy requirements
   via a reduction in body weight. Conversely, maintenance of reproductive
   function during the nonbreeding winter season carries greater metabolic
   costs; these costs lead to increased amounts of food required to
   maintain body weight.
