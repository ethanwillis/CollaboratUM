AB Circadian clocks in mammals are based on a negative feedback loop in
   which transcriptional repression by the cryptochromes, CRY1 and CRY2,
   lies at the heart of the mechanism. Despite similarities in sequence,
   domain structure, and biochemical activity, they play distinct roles in
   clock function. However, detailed biochemical studies have not been
   straightforward and Cry function has not been examined in real clock
   cells using kinetic measurements. In this study, we demonstrate, through
   cell-based genetic complementation and real-time molecular recording,
   that Cry1 alone is able to maintain cell-autonomous circadian rhythms,
   whereas Cry2 cannot. Using this novel functional assay, we identify a
   cryptochrome differentiating alpha-helical domain within the photolyase
   homology region (PHR) of CRY1, designated as CRY1-PHR(313-426), that is
   required for clock function and distinguishes CRY1 from CRY2. Contrary
   to speculation, the divergent carboxyl-terminal tail domain (CTD) is
   dispensable, but serves to modulate rhythm amplitude and period length.
   Finally, we identify the biochemical basis of their distinct function;
   CRY1 is a much more potent transcriptional repressor than CRY2, and the
   strength of repression by various forms of CRY proteins significantly
   correlates with rhythm amplitude. Taken together, our results
   demonstrate that CRY1-PHR(313-426), not the divergent CTD, is critical
   for clock function. These findings provide novel insights into the
   evolution of the diverse functions of the photolyase/cryptochrome family
   of flavoproteins and offer new opportunities for mechanistic studies of
   CRY function.

AB Circadian clocks sustain daily oscillations in gene expression,
   physiology, and behavior, relying on transcription-translation feedback
   loops of clock genes for rhythm generation. Cultured astrocytes display
   daily oscillations of extracellular ATP, suggesting that ATP release is
   a circadian output. We hypothesized that the circadian clock modulates
   ATP release via mechanisms that regulate acute ATP release from glia. To
   test the molecular basis for circadian ATP release, we developed methods
   to measure in real-time ATP release and Bmal1:: dLuc circadian reporter
   expression in cortical astrocyte cultures from mice of different
   genotypes. Daily rhythms of gene expression required functional Clock
   and Bmal1, both Per1 and Per2, and both Cry1 and Cry2 genes. Similarly,
   high-level, circadian ATP release also required a functional clock
   mechanism. Whereas blocking IP(3) signaling significantly disrupted ATP
   rhythms with no effect on Bmal1:: dLuc cycling, blocking vesicular
   release did not alter circadian ATP release or gene expression. We
   conclude that astrocytes depend on circadian clock genes and IP(3)
   signaling to express daily rhythms in ATP release.

AB Direct evidence for the requirement of delay in feedback repression in
   the mammalian circadian clock has been elusive. Cryptochrome 1 (Cry1),
   an essential clock component, displays evening-time expression and
   serves as a strong repressor at morning-time elements (E box/E' box). In
   this study, we reveal that a combination of day-time elements (D box)
   within the Cry1-proximal promoter and night-time elements (RREs) within
   its intronic enhancer gives rise to evening-time expression. A synthetic
   composite promoter produced evening-time expression, which was further
   recapitulated by a simple phase-vector model. Of note, coordination of
   day-time with night-time elements can modulate the extent of phase
   delay. A genetic complementation assay in Cry1(-/-):Cry2(-/-) cells
   revealed that substantial delay of Cry1 expression is required to
   restore circadian rhythmicity, and its prolonged delay slows circadian
   oscillation. Taken together, our data suggest that phase delay in Cry1
   transcription is required for mammalian clock function.

AB During fasting, mammals maintain normal glucose homeostasis by
   stimulating hepatic gluconeogenesis1. Elevations in circulating glucagon
   and epinephrine, two hormones that activate hepatic gluconeogenesis,
   trigger the cAMP-mediated phosphorylation of cAMP response
   element-binding protein (Creb) and dephosphorylation of the
   Creb-regulated transcription coactivator-2 (Crtc2)-two key
   transcriptional regulators of this process(2). Although the underlying
   mechanism is unclear, hepatic gluconeogenesis is also regulated by the
   circadian clock, which coordinates glucose metabolism with changes in
   the external environment(3-6). Circadian control of gene expression is
   achieved by two transcriptional activators, Clock and Bmal1, which
   stimulate cryptochrome (Cry1 and Cry2) and Period (Per1, Per2 and Per3)
   repressors that feed back on Clock-Bmal1 activity. Here we show that
   Creb activity during fasting is modulated by Cry1 and Cry2, which are
   rhythmically expressed in the liver. Cry1 expression was elevated during
   the night-day transition, when it reduced fasting gluconeogenic gene
   expression by blocking glucagon-mediated increases in intracellular cAMP
   concentrations and in the protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation of
   Creb. In biochemical reconstitution studies, we found that Cry1
   inhibited accumulation of cAMP in response to G protein-coupled receptor
   (GPCR) activation but not to forskolin, a direct activator of adenyl
   cyclase. Cry proteins seemed to modulate GPCR activity directly through
   interaction with G(s)alpha. As hepatic overexpression of Cry1 lowered
   blood glucose concentrations and improved insulin sensitivity in
   insulin-resistant db/db mice, our results suggest that compounds that
   enhance cryptochrome activity may provide therapeutic benefit to
   individuals with type 2 diabetes.

AB Bmal1 is an essential transcriptional activator within the mammalian
   circadian clock. We report here that the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN)
   of Bmal1-null mutant mice, unexpectedly, generates stochastic
   oscillations with periods that overlap the circadian range. Dissociated
   SCN neurons expressed fluctuating levels of PER2 detected by
   bioluminescence imaging but could not generate circadian oscillations
   intrinsically. Inhibition of intercellular communication or cyclic-AMP
   signaling in SCN slices, which provide a positive feed-forward signal to
   drive the intracellular negative feedback loop, abolished the stochastic
   oscillations. Propagation of this feed-forward signal between SCN
   neurons then promotes quasi-circadian oscillations that arise as an
   emergent property of the SCN network. Experimental analysis and
   mathematical model ingargue that both intercellular coupling and
   molecular noise are required for the stochastic rhythms, providing a
   novel biological example of noise-induced oscillations. The emergence of
   stochastic circadian oscillations from the SCN network in the absence of
   cell-autonomous circadian oscillatory function highlights a previously
   unrecognized level of circadian organization.

AB Two decades of research identified more than a dozen clock genes and
   defined a biochemical feedback mechanism of circadian oscillator
   function. To identify additional clock genes and modifiers, we conducted
   a genome-wide small interfering RNA screen in a human cellular clock
   model. Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. Potent
   effects on period length or increased amplitude were less frequent; we
   found hundreds of these and confirmed them in secondary screens.
   Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a
   dosage-dependent effect on oscillator function. Protein interaction
   network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or
   indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis
   revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of insulin and
   hedgehog signaling, the cell cycle, and the folate metabolism. Coupled
   with data showing many of these pathways are clock regulated, we
   conclude the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular
   function.

AB Circadian timekeeping by intracellular molecular clocks is evident
   widely in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The clockworks are driven by
   autoregulatory feedback loops that lead to oscillating levels of
   components whose maxima are in fixed phase relationships with one
   another. These phase relationships are the key metric characterizing the
   operation of the clocks. In this study, we built a mathematical model
   from the regulatory structure of the intracellular circadian clock in
   mice and identified its parameters using an iterative evolutionary
   strategy, with minimum cost achieved through conformance to phase
   separations seen in cell-autonomous oscillators. The model was evaluated
   against the experimentally observed cell-autonomous circadian phenotypes
   of gene knockouts, particularly retention of rhythmicity and changes in
   expression level of molecular clock components. These tests reveal
   excellent de novo predictive ability of the model. Furthermore,
   sensitivity analysis shows that these knockout phenotypes are robust to
   parameter perturbation.

AB The circadian clock controls daily oscillations of gene expression at
   the cellular level. We report the development of a high-throughput
   circadian functional assay system that consists of luminescent reporter
   cells, screening automation, and a data analysis pipeline. We applied
   this system to further dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying the
   mammalian circadian clock using a chemical biology approach. We analyzed
   the effect of 1,280 pharmacologically active compounds with diverse
   structures on the circadian period length that is indicative of the core
   clock mechanism. Our screening paradigm identified many compounds
   previously known to change the circadian period or phase, demonstrating
   the validity of the assay system. Furthermore, we found that small
   molecule inhibitors of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) consistently
   caused a strong short period phenotype in contrast to the well-known
   period lengthening by lithium, another presumed GSK-3 inhibitor.
   siRNA-mediated knockdown of GSK-3 beta also caused a short period,
   confirming the phenotype obtained with the small molecule inhibitors.
   These results clarify the role of GSK-3 beta in the period regulation of
   the mammalian clockworks and highlight the effectiveness of chemical
   biology in exploring unidentified mechanisms of the circadian clock.

AB The mammalian circadian clockwork is composed of a core PER/CRY feedback
   loop and additional interlocking loops. In particular, the ROR/REV/Bmal1
   loop, consisting of ROR activators and REV-ERB repressors that regulate
   Bmal1 expression, is thought to "stabilize'' core clock function.
   However, due to functional redundancy and pleiotropic effects of gene
   deletions, the role of the ROR/REV/Bmal1 loop has not been accurately
   defined. In this study, we examined cell-autonomous circadian
   oscillations using combined gene knockout and RNA interference and
   demonstrated that REV-ERB alpha and beta are functionally redundant and
   are required for rhythmic Bmal1 expression. In contrast, the RORs
   contribute to Bmal1 amplitude but are dispensable for Bmal1 rhythm. We
   provide direct in vivo genetic evidence that the REV-ERBs also
   participate in combinatorial regulation of Cry1 and Rorc expression,
   leading to their phase-delay relative to Rev-erb alpha. Thus, the
   REV-ERBs play a more prominent role than the RORs in the basic clock
   mechanism. The cellular genetic approach permitted testing of the
   robustness of the intracellular core clock function. We showed that
   cells deficient in both REV-ERB alpha and beta function, or those
   expressing constitutive BMAL1, were still able to generate and maintain
   normal Per2 rhythmicity. Our findings thus underscore the resilience of
   the intracellular clock mechanism and provide important insights into
   the transcriptional topologies underlying the circadian clock. Since
   REV-ERB function and Bmal1 mRNA/protein cycling are not necessary for
   basic clock function, we propose that the major role of the
   ROR/REV/Bmal1 loop and its constituents is to control rhythmic
   transcription of clock output genes.

AB Virtually all cells in the body have an intracellular clockwork based on
   a negative feedback mechanism. The circadian timekeeping system in
   mammals is a hierarchical multi- oscillator network, with the
   suprachiasmatic nuclei ( SCN) acting as the central pacemaker. The SCN
   synchronizes to daily light- dark cycles and coordinates rhythmic
   physiology and behavior. Synchronization in the SCN and at the
   organismal level is a key feature of the circadian clock system. In
   particular, intercellular coupling in the SCN synchronizes neuron
   oscillators and confers robustness against perturbations. Recent
   advances in our knowledge of and ability to manipulate circadian rhythms
   make available cell- based clock models, which lack strong coupling and
   are ideal for target discovery and chemical biology.

AB Molecular mechanisms of the mammalian circadian clock have been studied
   primarily by genetic perturbation and behavioral analysis. Here, we used
   bioluminescence imaging to monitor Per2 gene expression in tissues and
   cells from clock mutant mice. We discovered that Per1 and Cry1 are
   required for sustained rhythms in peripheral tissues and cells, and in
   neurons dissociated from the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN). Per2 is also
   required for sustained rhythms, whereas Cry2 and Per3 deficiencies cause
   only period length defects. However, oscillator network interactions in
   the SCN can compensate for Per1 or Cry1 deficiency, preserving sustained
   rhythmicity in mutant SCN slices and behavior. Thus, behavior does not
   necessarily reflect cell-autonomous clock phenotypes. Our studies reveal
   previously unappreciated requirements for Per1, Per2, and Cry1 in
   sustaining cellular circadian rhythmicity and demonstrate that SCN
   intercellular coupling is essential not only to synchronize component
   cellular oscillators but also for robustness against genetic
   perturbations.
