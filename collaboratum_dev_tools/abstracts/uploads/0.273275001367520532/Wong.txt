AB The bacterial phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP)-dependent group translocation
   system (PTS) requires the presence of both membrane-bound and
   cytoplasmic components to phosphorylate and translocate sugar.
   Deinococcus radiodurans has a functional fruA gene coding for the
   membrane-bound components of the fructose-specific PTS. However, fruB
   gene coding for the fructose-specific cytosolic components of PTS is a
   pseudogene. Yet, this bacterium metabolized fructose readily. In vitro
   studies showed that both cell membranes and cytoplasmic fractions of the
   cells were needed for fructose phosphorylation. Further studies showed
   that fructose phosphorylation required ATP, not PEP, as the phosphate
   donor. Unlike most PEP-dependent PTS systems, fructose phosphorylation
   is sensitive to sodium fluoride, a kinase inhibitor. Fructose
   phosphorylation was also inhibited in the presence of antiserum against
   a kinase phosphorylation site. Rhodobacter capsulatus has a functional
   fruA-fruB system. Complementation assays by reconstituting the membrane
   fraction of D. radiodurans to the cytoplasmic fraction of R. capsulatus
   resulted in a PEP-dependent fructose phosphorylation, whereas mixing the
   membranes of R. capsulatus and the deinococcal cytosol in vitro resulted
   in an ATP-dependent fructose phosphorylation.

AB The codeword design problem is an important problem in DNA computing and
   its applications. Several theoretical analyses as well as practical
   solutions for short oligonucleotides (up to 20-mers) have been generated
   recently. These solutions have, in turn, suggested new applications to
   DNA-based indexing and natural language processing, in addition to the
   obvious applications to the problems of reliability and scalability that
   generated them. Here we continue the exploration of this type of
   DNA-based indexing for biological applications and show that DNA
   noncrosshybridizing (nxh) sets can be successfully applied to infer ab
   initio phylogenetic trees by providing a way to measure distances among
   different genomes indexed by sets of short oligonucleotides selected so
   as to minimize crosshybridization. These phylogenies are solidly
   established and well accepted in biology. The new technique is much more
   effective in terms of signal-to-noise ratio, cost and time than current
   methods. Second, it is demonstrated that DNA indexing does provide novel
   and principled insights into the phylogenesis of organisms hitherto
   inaccessible by current methods, such as a prediction of the origin of
   the Salmonella plasmid 50 as being acquired horizontally, likely from
   some bacteria somewhat related to Yesinia. Finally, DNA indexing can be
   scaled up to newly available universal DNA chips readily available both
   in vitro and in silico. In particular, we show how a recently obtained
   such set of nxh 16-mers can be used as a universal coordinate system in
   DNA spaces to characterize very large groups (families, genera, and even
   phylla) of organisms on a uniform biomarker reference system, a
   veritable and comprehensive "Atlas of Life", as it is or as it could be
   on earth.

AB Hidden stops are nucleotide triples TAA, TAG and TGA that appear on the
   second and third reading frames of a protein coding gene. Recent studies
   suggested the important role of hidden stops in preventing misread of
   mRNA. We study the problem of designing protein-encoding genes with
   large number of hidden stops under several biological constraints. With
   simple constraints, redesigned genes have provable maximal number of
   hidden stops. With more complex constraints, redesigned genes still have
   many more hidden stops than wild-type genes. We showed that redesigned
   genes have a distinct positional advantage in assisting early
   termination of frame-shifts.

   sequencing were used to analyze the ribotypes of microbial communities
   associated with corals. Both healthy and diseased coral of different
   species were collected at three locations off the southern coast of
   Taiwan. Ribotyping results suggested that the microbial communities were
   diverse. The microbial community profiles, even among the same species
   of corals from different geographical locations, differ significantly.
   The coral-associated bacterial communities contain many bacteria common
   to the habitants of various invertebrates. However, some bacteria were
   unexpected. The presence of some unusual species, such as
   Staphylococcus, Clostridium and Legionella, associated with corals that
   were likely the results of human activities. Human activities, such as
   thermal pollution from the nearby nuclear plant, active fishing and
   tourism industries in the region might have all contributed to the
   change in bacterial communities and the death of coral colonies around

AB When the stop codons TGA, TAA, and TAG are found in the second and third
   reading frames of a protein-encoding gene, they are considered premature
   stop codons (PSC). Deinococcus radiodurans disproportionately favored
   TGA more than the other two triplets as a PSC. The TGA triplet was also
   found more often in noncoding regions and as a stop codon, though the
   bias was less pronounced. We investigated this phenomenon in 72
   bacterial species with widely differing chromosomal GC contents.
   Although TGA and TAG were compositionally similar, we found a great
   variation in use of TGA but a very limited range of use of TAG. The
   frequency of use of TGA in the gene sequences generally increased with
   the GC content of the chromosome, while the frequency of use of TAG,
   like that of TAA, was inversely proportional to the GC content of the
   chromosome. The patterns of use of TAA, TGA and TAG as real stop codons
   were less biased and less influenced by the GC content of the
   chromosome. Bacteria with higher chromosomal GC contents often contained
   fewer PSC trimers in their genes. Phylogenetically related bacteria
   often exhibited similar PSC ratios. In addition, metabolically versatile
   bacteria have significantly fewer PSC trimers in their genes. The bias
   toward TGA but against TAG as a PSC could not be explained either by the
   preferential usage of specific codons or by the GC contents of
   individual chromosomes. We proposed that the quantity and the quality of
   the PSC in the genome might be important in bacterial evolution.

AB The key enzyme of the glycolytic pathway of Deinococcus radiodurans,
   fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase, could be induced independently by
   glucose and Mn. The enzyme exhibited the characteristics of the
   metal-dependent Class II aldolases. Unlike most Class II aldolases, the
   deinococcal aldolase preferred Mn, not Zn, as a cofactor. The fbaA gene
   encoding the deinococcal aldolase was cloned and the protein
   overproduced in various Escherichia coli expression hosts. However, the
   overexpressed deinococcal enzyme aggregated and formed inclusion bodies.
   Dissolving these inclusion bodies by urea and subsequent purification by
   nickel affinity chromatography, resulted in a protein fraction that
   exhibited aldolase activity only in the presence of Mn. This active
   aldolase fraction exhibited masses of about 70 kDa and 35 kDa by gel
   filtration and by SDS gel electrophoresis, respectively, suggesting that
   the active aldolase was a dimer.

   of mutations involved, such as transversion or transition, these four
   nitro-group containing compounds were tested with S. typhimurium strains
   TA100, TA104, TA4001 and TA4006. Dose-mutagenicity relationships

   compounds in TA100. The TA-AT transversion also contributed to the
   mutagenicity of 4-nitro-o-phenylenediamine and
   4,4'-dinitro-2-biphenylamine in TA104. These nitro-group containing
   compounds showed no mutagenicity in TA4001, but induced CG-GC
   transversion in TA4006. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Extracts from the unicellular green alga Selenastrum capricornutum
   exhibit high superoxide dismutase activity, but only traces of catalase
   activity. The excess hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) generated by the
   superoxide dismutase in S. capricornutum may be degraded by a unique
   peroxidase. This peroxidase has a high specificity for ascorbate as its
   electron donor. The enzyme has an optimum pH at 8, is insensitive to
   cyanide and is inhibited by oxine. Addition of low concentrations of
   copper to algal cultures stimulates the peroxidase activity threefold.
   This enzymatic system could be used as a sensitive bioindicator for
   copper in fresh water.

AB Benzamines are the major aromatic amines used in industry and can also
   be released from azo dyes, which are widely used in the textile,
   paper-making, and food industries. The toxicity of 10 benzamines was
   tested by the well diffusion assay technique against 18 common bacterial
   species including the nitrogen-fixing bacterium Azotobacter vinelandii.
   p-Phenylenediamine was found to be inhibitory to the growth of Aeromonas
   hydrophila and Pseudomonas fluorescens. o-Phenylenediamine was
   inhibitory to Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pnemoniae, Salmonella
   enteritidis, and Shigella sonnei. 2,5-Diaminotoluene was inhibitory to
   the growth of P. fluorescens and Streptococcus mitis. The growth of A.
   vinelandii was inhibited by p-phenylenediamine and 2,5-diaminotoluene in
   the well diffusion assay. p-Nitroaniline was also found to be inhibitory
   to the growth of A. vinelandii in Burk's nitrogen-free medium. The
   nitrogenase activity of A. vinelandii was inhibited by
   p-phenylenediamine, 2,5-diaminotoluene, p-nitroaniline,
   2-nitro-p-phenylenediamine, 3-nitro-o-phenylenediamine, and
   4-nitro-o-phenylenediamine. Because many of these organisms are common
   soil and aquatic bacteria, the accumulation of these benzamine compounds
   in the environment may have an adverse impact on soil biochemical
   activities.

AB Metabolism of chloral hydrate (CH) by male B6C3F(1) mouse liver
   microsomes (control-microsomes) generated free radical intermediates
   that resulted in endogenous lipid peroxidation, forming malondialdehyde
   (MDA), formaldehyde (FA), acetaldehyde (ACT), acetone, and
   propionaldehyde. Because MDA, FA, and ACT are tumorigens, endogenous
   formation of lipid peroxidation products via a free radical mechanism
   may be responsible for hepatocellular tumorigenicity of CH to the
   B6C3F(1) mice. Trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and trichloroethanol (TCE),
   the primary metabolites of CH, also generated free radicals and induced
   lipid peroxidation. Lipid peroxidation from TCA equaled that induced by
   CH, whereas that from TCE was 3- to 4-fold lower, suggesting that
   metabolism of CH to TCA may be the predominant pathway leading to lipid
   peroxidation. Metabolism of CH, TCA, and TCE by liver microsomes of mice
   pretreated with pyrazole (pyrazole-microsomes) yielded lipid
   peroxidation products at a level 2- to 3-fold higher than those from
   liver microsomes of untreated mice. In addition, CH-induced lipid
   peroxidation catalyzed by control-microsomes and pyrazole-microsomes was
   reduced significantly by 2,4-dichloro-6-phenylphenoxyethylamine, a
   general cytochrome P450 inhibitor. Thus, our study suggests that
   cytochrome P450 is the enzyme catalyzing the metabolic activation of CH
   and its metabolites; (TCA and TCE) leading to lipid peroxidation, and
   that CYP2E1 may be the major isozyme responsible. This latter conclusion
   was supported by results using human lymphoblastoid cells expressing
   cytochrome P4502E1, which metabolized CH to reactants inducing
   mutations, whereas the parental cell line was inactive.

AB Metabolism of chloral hydrate by male B6C3F(1) mouse liver microsomes
   generates free radical intermediate(s) as evidenced by electron spin
   resonance spectroscopic analysis. The subsequent induction of endogenous
   lipid peroxidation was shown by analysis of the resulting products with
   high-pressure liquid chromatography. Chloral hydrate was found mutagenic
   in Salmonella typhimurium strain TA104. Both lipid peroxidation and
   mutagenicity were efficiently inhibited by free radical scavengers,
   alpha-tocopherol and menadione. (C) 1994 Academic Press, Inc.
