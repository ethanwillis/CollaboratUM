AB The zebrafish, Danio rerio, a small, tropical freshwater species native
   to Pakistan and India, has become a National Institutes of
   Health-sanctioned model organism and, due to its many advantages as an
   experimental vertebrate, it has garnered intense interest from the
   world's scientific community. Some have labeled the zebrafish, the
   "vertebrate Drosophila," due to its genetic tractability, small size,
   low cost, and rapid development. The transparency of the embryo,
   external development, and the many hundreds of mutant and transgenic
   lines available add to the allure. Now it appears, the zebrafish can be
   used for high-throughput screening (HTS) of drug libraries in the
   discovery process of promising new therapeutics. In this review, various
   types of screening methods are briefly outlined, as are a variety of
   screens for different disease models, to highlight the range of
   zebrafish HTS possibilities. High-content screening (HCS) has been
   available for cell-based screens for some time and, very recently, HCS
   is being adapted for the zebrafish. This will allow analysis, at high
   resolution, of drug effects on whole vertebrates; thus, whole body
   effects as well as those on specific organs and tissues may be
   determined. Birth Defects Research (Part C) 93:268-280, 2011. (C) 2011

AB Flatbed transparency scanners are typically relegated to routine office
   tasks, yet they do offer a variety of potentially useful imaging tools
   for the zebrafish laboratory. These include motility screens, oocyte
   maturation and egg activation assays as well as counting and measuring
   tasks. When coupled with Macroscheduler (http://www.mjtnet.com) and
   ImageJ (http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij), the scanner becomes a stable platform
   for imaging large arrays of zebrafish oocytes, embryos, larvae, and
   adults. Such large arrays are a prerequisite to the development of
   high-throughput screens for small molecules as potential therapeutic
   drugs in the treatment of many diseases including cancer and epilepsy.
   Thus the scanner may have a role in adapting zebrafish to future drug
   and mutagenesis screening. In this chapter, some of the uses of scanners
   are outlined to bring attention to the potentials of this simple-to-use,
   flexible, inexpensive device for the zebrafish research community.

AB The process of oogenesis culminates in steroid-induced oocyte maturation
   to produce the fertilizable egg. A quintessential biological entity, the
   egg is central to the production of new individuals. The result of egg
   fertilization by a sperm cell is the production of the mother of all
   stem cells (i.e. the zygote). Furthermore, the egg cytoplasm is the only
   one known to support reprogramming a transplanted nucleus to give rise
   to an individual (i.e. animal cloning). Zebrafish oocyte maturation is a
   complex event encompassing a number of cellular changes including
   germinal vesicle migration (GVM) and dissolution or breakdown (GVD),
   ooplasmic clearing (OC) with correlated yolk protein changes (YP),
   development of osmoregulation (OR) in fresh water, the formation of the
   future embryonic pole, the blastodisc (BF) and activatibility (AC) or
   cortical maturation. In zebrafish, and many other teleosts, 17 alpha, 20
   beta-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one (17 alpha, 20 beta-DP) has been shown to
   be the normal inducer of oocyte maturation. A 17 alpha, 20 beta-DP
   membrane-resident receptor mediates oocyte maturation via non-genomic
   mechanisms that are beginning to be understood. This paper will
   highlight some of the cellular markers resulting from the signaling
   initiated by 17 alpha, 20 beta-DP. By describing these markers, it is
   hoped that workers in the field will have additional tools to help
   further elucidate the signaling events of oocyte maturation. (c) 2008

AB The tubulin gene family is important for individual zebrafish
   development from the oocyte through to hatching. This involves often
   rapid, complex changes in the gametes and embryonic cells that are
   reflected in underlying gene expression changes. Tubulin dynamics, i.e.,
   the interchange of polymeric and soluble forms in zebrafish oogenesis
   and embryogenesis, is important for microtubule (MT) cellular functions.
   Nevertheless, our understanding of how tubulin gene expression changes
   during zebrafish development is not clear. Previous data showed that
   soluble alpha-tubulin and gamma-tubulin are associated with large
   molecular weight complexes (>2 MDa) which are reduced by the blastula
   stage, with a concomitant decrease in soluble tubulin amount. Complexes
   (<2 MDa) then increased in the gastrula with an increase in soluble
   tubulin. Microarray revealed similar patterns of tubulin gene product
   expression for zebrafish ovary and eggs while both differed from day 4
   larva. In situ hybridization with gamma-tubulin oligonucleotide probes
   revealed diffuse label in oocytes, with a marked localization to the
   primordial blastodise upon maturation. These findings, together with
   recent work on gamma-tubulin ring complexes in other species, suggest
   that gamma-tubulin (protein complexes) may be involved in regulating
   tubulin dynamics, thus is important for zebrafish oogenesis and
   embryogenesis. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Tubulin dynamics, i.e., the interchange of polymeric and soluble forms,
   is important for microtubule (MTs) cellular functions, and thus plays
   essential roles in zebrafish oogenesis and embryogenesis. A novel
   finding in this study revealed that there were soluble pools of tubulins
   in zebrafish oocytes that were sequestered and maintained in a temporary
   "oligomeric" state, which retained assembling and disassembling
   potential (suggested by undetected acetylated tubulin, marker of stable
   tubulin), but lacked abilities to assemble into MTs spontaneously in
   vivo. Using differential centrifugation, gel chromatography and
   DM1A-probed western blot, soluble alpha-tubulin was found to be
   associated with large molecular weight complexes (MW range to over 2
   MDa) which were reduced in amount by the blastula stage, especially in
   some batches of embryos, with a concomitant decrease in soluble tubulin.
   Complexes (MW range less than 2 MDa) then increased in the gastrula with
   an increase in soluble alpha-tubulin. Two different anti-gamma-tubulin
   monoclonal antibodies, GTU 88 and TU 30, revealed the existence of
   soluble-gamma-tubulin in both zebrafish oocytes and embryos, which also
   decreased by the blastula stage and increased in the gastrula stage.
   Soluble alpha-tubulin and gamma-tubulin extracted from zebrafish
   ovaries, oocytes and embryos co-localized in fractions on three
   different columns: S-200 Sephacryl, DEAE and Superose-6b. The soluble
   tubulin complexes were competent to assemble into MTs in vitro induced
   by taxol, and gamma-tubulin was co-localized with assembled MTs. These
   soluble tubulin complexes were stable during freeze-thaw cycles and
   resisted high ionic interaction (up to 1.5 M NaC1). Furthermore, some
   ovarian soluble alpha-tubulin could be co-immunoprecipitated with
   gamma-tubulin, and vice versa. Two antibodies specific for Xenopus
   gamma-tubulin ring complex proteins (Xgrip 109 and Xgrip 195) detected
   single bands from ovarian extracts in western blots, suggesting the
   existence of Xgrip 109 and Xgrip 195 homologues in zebrafish. These
   findings, together with recent work on gamma-tubulin ring complexes in
   oocytes, eggs and embryos of other species, suggest that soluble
   gamma-tubulin-associated protein complexes may be involved in regulating
   tubulin dynamics during zebrafish oogenesis and embryogenesis. (c) 2007

AB We have developed a new technique called Computer-Aided Meiotic
   Maturation Assay (GAMMA) for imaging large arrays of zebrafish oocytes
   and automatically collecting image files at regular intervals during
   meiotic maturation. This novel method uses a transparency scanner
   interfaced to a computer with macro programming that automatically scans
   and archives the image files. Images are stacked and analyzed with
   ImageJ to quantify changes in optical density characteristic of
   zebrafish oocyte maturation. Major advantages of GAMMA include (1)
   ability to image very large arrays of oocytes and follow individual
   cells over time, (2) simultaneously image many treatment groups, (3)
   digitized images may be stacked, animated, and analyzed in programs such
   as ImageJ, NIH-Image, or ScionImage, and (4) GAMMA system is
   inexpensive, costing less than most microscopes used in traditional
   assays. We have used GAMMA to determine the dose response and time
   course of oocyte maturation induced by 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone
   (HP). Maximal decrease in optical density occurs around 5 hr after 0.1
   ug/ml HP (28.5 degrees C), approximately 3 hr after germinal vesicle
   migration (GVM) and dissolution (GVD). In addition to changes in optical
   density, GVD is accompanied by streaming of ooplasm to the animal pole
   to form a blastodisc. These dynamic changes are readily visualized by
   animating image stacks from GAMMA; thus, GAMMA provides a valuable
   source of time-lapse movies for those studying zebrafish oocyte
   maturation. The oocyte clearing documented by GAMMA is correlated to
   changes in size distribution of major yolk proteins upon SDS-PAGE, and,
   this in turn, is related to increased cyclin B-1 protein.

AB Oocytes of the leopard frog, Rana pipiens, contain soluble tubulin which
   was previously shown to exist predominately in megadalton (MDa)
   fractions and that fails to readily assemble in vitro. In order to
   further characterize these tubulin complexes, DEAE Sepharose
   chromatography, Sephacryl S-300 size exclusion columns and specific
   immunoprecipitation were used. The results revealed the presence of
   alpha-, beta-, and gamma -tubulin associated with several other proteins
   in the soluble fraction of Rana pipiens ovarian oocytes. These Rana
   oocyte tubulin complexes appear to be analogous to those recently
   reported in Xenopus ovulated eggs as gamma -tubulin ring complexes. This
   seems true since both size (estimates, i.e. similar to 2MDa) and protein
   components are similar. Furthermore, both alpha- and gamma -tubulin
   antibodies immunoprecipitated identical protein bands from Rana oocyte
   soluble fraction. These putative Rana gamma -tubulin ring proteins
   include 107, 97, 95, 90 and 75 kDa components which are similar in size
   to those found in Xenopus and other species. Rana appears to belong to a
   select group in which gamma -tubulin complexes contain significant
   alpha- and beta -tubulin (i.e., Xenopus and sheep), while other species
   such as Drosophila, Aspergillus, Saccharomyces, human cells and many
   other mammalian cells tested lack the other tubulin components. The
   heterogeneity in both size and protein components of Rana oocyte gamma
   -tubulin ring complexes may reflect different states of tubulin complex
   assembly. The lower vertebrate oocyte is hypothesized to act as a
   repository and prestaging point for the assembly of gamma -tubulin ring
   complexes which will become the maternal contribution to the centrosomes
   of the embryo. While the gamma -tubulin ring complexes of vertebrate
   eggs have been described previously, this is the first report
   biochemically characterizing soluble gamma -tubulin complexes in
   vertebrate ovarian oocytes.

AB During progesterone-induced oocyte maturation, the cell is converted
   from prophase I to metaphase II, which is known to involve microtubule
   changes. We hypothesize that progesterone affects the polymeric state of
   tubulins, isoform dynamics, as well as tubulin synthesis and
   degradation. To test the former, leopard frog (Rana pipiens) oocytes
   were treated with progesterone, homogenized and centrifuged at 16,000 x
   g. The resulting pellet and supernatant fractions were analyzed using
   immunoblots probed with anti-beta-tubulin antibody DM1A and
   anti-beta-tubulin antibody DM1B. The results indicate that the majority
   of tubulins are in supernatant fractions (soluble cellular component)
   and further indicate changes in size of pelletable tubulins with time
   post-progesterone treatment. To characterize the supernatant tubulins,
   Superose-Gb columns were used to fractionate 16,000 x g supernatant
   materials. The results indicate tubulins in fractions of up to 5 MDa
   (equivalent in size to c. 50 tubulin dimers or 5,000 kDa) predominate,
   while tubulin dimers and monomers of 110 kDa and 55 kDa, respectively,
   are relatively minor components. The tubulin in MDa fraction pools in
   the oocyte soluble component seem to be tissue specific, since the
   reverse patterns were found in either frog brain or rat (Rattus
   norvegicus) brain tissue under the same conditions. Microtubule poisons,
   taxol and nocodazole, were used to test the dynamics of tubulin in MDa
   fractions and the results were opposite to that expected, i.e., taxol, a
   microtubule stabilizer, decreased tubulin in large MDa fractions while
   nocodazole, a microtubule destabilizer, increased it. Preliminary data
   also indicated that progesterone treatment alters the tubulin size
   classes (size-shift) in comparison with that in immature oocytes. These
   results, in combination with other research reports, suggest that
   tubulin in MDa fractions may either be associated with other cellular
   components or act as intermediates in microtubule dynamics, perhaps via
   oligomerization, during oocyte maturation and early development. (C)

AB Microinjection of anti-alpha-tubulin (Dm1A) inhibited
   progesterone-induced meiotic maturation in large follicle-enclosed
   oocytes of the frog, Rana pipiens. DM1A (46 nl; 10 mg/ml) injection
   significantly increased the ED50 value for progesterone as determined by
   germinal vesicle dissolution (GVD) bioassay. By contrast, low doses of
   microinjected DM1A (46 nl; 2.5 mg/ml), anti-actin (clone KJ43A),
   anti-cytokeratin (C-11), anti-intermediate filament antibody (IFA),
   generic IgG (46 nl; 20 mg/ml) or sodium azide (46 nl; 1 mg/ml), an
   antibody preservative, were without inhibitory effect in this bioassay.
   Microinjected, affinity-purified DM1A (46 nl; 7.5 mg/ml) was also
   inhibitory, but preabsorption with pure tubulin prior to injection
   significantly reduced the inhibitory effect. DM1A injection had no
   effect on centrifugation-induced germinal vesicle migration (GVM).
   Previous work indicated that drugs (e.g. demecolcine and nocodazole),
   which destabilise microtubules, enhance both centrifugation-induced GVM
   and progesterone-induced GVD in Rana oocytes. Taking these results
   together, it is suggested that DM1A injection may have differential
   effects on microtubules in this cell. Thus, while the majority of
   microtubules were apparently depolymerised by DM1A (46 nl; 10 mg/ml)
   injection, a small subpopulation appeared to be stabilised as bundles.
   Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy of follicle-enclosed oocytes
   after DM1A injection revealed a major loss of microtubules throughout
   the cell; however, apparent sparse bundles of microtubules arranged in
   an approximately 600 mu m shell were associated with the injectate
   region 24h post-injection. By contrast, control follicle-enclosed
   oocytes topically labelled with DM1A post-fixation had extensive
   microtubule arrays similar to those previously reported in Xenopus
   oocytes. Intracellular recording after DM1A injection and progesterone
   treatment yielded an intermediate membrane potential (V-m = -31.8 mV)
   compared with control (immature) DM1A-injected cells (V-m = -44.7mV) or
   potassium balanced salt solution (KBS)-injected cells matured with
   progesterone (V-m = -13.9mV). These results suggest that DM1A injection
   does not completely inhibit electrophysiological changes initiated by
   progesterone. Working hypotheses are proposed that suggest a role for
   microtubules in the action of progesterone which normally lifts the
   prophase I block in the Rana follicle-enclosed oocyte.

   the acinus contracted, its lumen became smaller while the adlumenal cell
   became wider. Actin was demonstrated in salivary glands using an

AB Biopsies were performed to study the ovarian dynamics of a breeding
   population of free-living female gray treefrogs, Hyla chrysoscelis, in
   western Tennessee. This study used a longitudinal design in which
   individual females were biopsied up to four separate times in the same
   breeding season. All of the postspawning ovaries (n = 149) contained a
   series of enlarged follicles (mean follicle diameter = 0.305 mm), a
   condition that apparently facilitates repeated spawning during a
   prolonged breeding season. The size-frequency distribution of follicles
   remaining in the ovary after spawning was similar among all females
   (unimodal between 0.10 and 0.30 mm diameter) indicating that
   vitellogenic growth of this pool of follicles is slowed or arrested
   while another series of larger follicles (those that will comprise the
   next clutch) nears maturation. The average size of the follicles
   remaining in the ovary after spawning was not correlated with female
   body size, clutch number, time (month) during the breeding season, the
   number of days since last oviposition, or the number of days it took
   females to oviposit their next clutch. Thus, the ability to oviposit
   more than one clutch in a breeding season may depend primarily on the
   foraging success of females, an idea supported by the observation that
   fat bodies were generally not available as an energy source for the
   production of multiple clutches after the start of the breeding season.
   Ovarian biopsies performed in Nov. on captive frogs indicated that
   females may enter winter dormancy with or without enlarged ovaries, a
   condition that may also depend on the nutritional condition of the
   female.

   modified tubulins. All samples, with the exception of that from brain
   where the reverse was true, contained more tyrosinated than
   detyrosinated alpha-tubulin. Additionally, extracts from brain and
   testes exhibited acetylated alpha-tubulin whereas this isoform was not
   visualized on blots of cell-free preparations from follicles and CCL-71
   cells. Assembly of brain and ovary tubulin was induced with taxol. Brain
   tubulin, partially purified through three cycles of assembly/disassembly
   was associated with a variety of putative microtubule-associated
   proteins (MAPs), most of which had a high molecular mass. There were
   very few cold stable microtubules in brain preparations whereas, for
   ovary, purification of tubulin was hampered by significant losses of
   cold stable polymer. Comparison son of brain and ovary showed there was
   no correlation between the extent of alpha-tubulin detyrosination or
   acetylation and cold stability of microtubules. Moreover, cycled tubulin
   from ovary contained acetylated tubulin even though this was not
   observed on blots of cell-free extracts from ovary or from follicles.
   Cultured goldfish cells contained extensive arrays of microtubules, many
   of which originated from discrete organizing centers. The results reveal
   the widespread distribution of posttranslationally modified tubulins in
   goldfish tissues, the differing assembly/disassembly characteristics of
   tubulin from brain versus ovary, and the presence of putative neural
   MAPs, mostly with a high molecular mass.

   3. Oocyte fractions isolated in microtubule-stabilizing detergent buffer
   were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blots were probed with monoclonal
   antibodies to tubulins.
   4. In the fully-grown ovarian follicle (diameter approx. 1.7 mm), the
   majority of tubulin was present in the supernatant fraction.
   5. Tubulin was routinely detected in the medium speed (16,000 g)
   prophase I oocyte pellet.
   6. Nocodazole treatment of ovarian follicles in vitro reduced the
   pelletable tubulin detected, while taxol increased tubulin in the pellet
   and decreased the supernatant tubulin.
   7. These results indicate that taxol is useful in the purification of
   brain and testes tubulin from Rana tissue; while oocyte tubulin appears
   to respond to taxol in vivo, another method will be required for in
   vitro assembly and purification of ovarian tubulin.
