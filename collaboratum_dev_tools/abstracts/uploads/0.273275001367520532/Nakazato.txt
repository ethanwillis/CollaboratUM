AB Premise of the study: Wild relatives of crop species have long been
   viewed as an important genetic resource for crop improvement, but basic
   information about the population biology of these species is often
   lacking. This study investigated the population structure, demographic
   history, and evolutionary patterns of a green-fruited relative of the
   cultivated tomato, Solanum peruvianum.
   Methods: We investigated spatial genetics of S. peruvianum and screened
   for loci potentially under natural selection by integrating amplified
   fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) genotypes, phenotypic data,
   geography, and geographic information system (GIS)-derived climate data
   of 19 natural populations.
   Key results: Solanum peruvianum had a moderate degree of population
   differentiation, likely reflecting partial geographic isolation between
   species. Populations had a distribution pattern consistent with
   north-to-south "stepping-stone" dispersal with significant isolation by
   distance (IBD), similar to other tomato species. Several AFLP loci
   showed evidence of selection and associated with climate variables.
   However, phenotypic traits generally did not correlate with climate
   variables.
   Conclusions: Geographic features of the coastal Andes is likely an
   important factor that determines the migration pattern and population
   structure of S. peruvianum, but climatic factors do not appear to be
   critical for its phenotypic evolution, perhaps due to a high degree of
   phenotypic plasticity. Spatial genetics of wild relatives of crop
   species is a powerful approach to understand their evolutionary patterns
   and to accelerate the discovery of their potential for crop
   improvements.

AB Premise of the study : Understanding the demographic history of natural
   populations in relation to the geographic features in their habitats is
   an important step toward deciphering the mechanisms of evolutionary
   processes in nature. This study investigates how the complex geographic
   and ecological features of the Andes play a role in demographic history,
   species divergence, dispersal patterns, and hybridization in wild tomato
   species.
   Methods : We investigated spatial genetics of two closely related wild
   tomato species, Solanum lycopersicum and S. pimpinellifolium, by
   integrating amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) marker data
   and geographic information system (GIS)-derived geographic and climatic
   data.
   Key results : The two species represent genetically distinct lineages
   largely separated by the Andes, but hybridize extensively in central to
   northern Ecuador, likely mediated by the transitional climatic
   conditions between those of the two species. Solanum lycospericum has
   likely experienced a severe population bottleneck during the
   colonization of the eastern Andes followed by a rapid population
   expansion.
   Conclusions : The study demonstrates that the evolutionary patterns of
   the two wild tomatoes, including demographic history, dispersal
   patterns, interspecific divergence, and hybridization, are intimately
   related to the complex geographic and ecological features of the Andes.
   Integrating genetic data across the genome and GIS-derived environmental
   data can provide insights into the patterns of complex evolutionary
   processes in nature.

AB Among the reproductive barriers that can isolate species, hybrid
   sterility is frequently due to dysfunctional interactions between loci
   that accumulate between differentiating lineages. Theory describing the
   evolution of these incompatibilities has generated the prediction, still
   empirically untested, that loci underlying hybrid incompatibility should
   accumulate faster than linearly with time-the "snowball effect." We
   evaluated the accumulation of quantitative trait loci (QTL) between
   species in the plant group Solanum and found evidence for a
   faster-than-linear accumulation of hybrid seed sterility QTL, thus
   empirically evaluating and confirming this theoretical prediction. In
   comparison, loci underlying traits unrelated to hybrid sterility show no
   evidence for an accelerating rate of accumulation between species.

AB Understanding the role of geography and ecology in species divergence is
   central to the study of evolutionary diversification. We used climatic,
   geographic, and biological data from nine wild Andean tomato species to
   describe each species' ecological niche and to evaluate the likely
   ecological and geographical modes of speciation in this clade. Using
   data from >1000 wild accessions and publicly available data derived from
   geographic information systems for various environmental variables, we
   found most species pairs were significantly differentiated for one or
   more environmental variables. By comparing species' predicted niches
   generated by species distribution modeling (SDM), we found significant
   niche differentiation among three of four sister-species pairs,
   suggesting ecological divergence is consistently associated with recent
   divergence. In comparison, based on age-range correlation (ARC)
   analysis, there was no evidence for a predominant geographical
   (allopatric vs. sympatric) context for speciation in this group.
   Overall, our results suggest an important role for environmentally
   mediated differentiation, rather than simply geographical isolation, in
   species divergence.

AB As a first step in elucidating mechanisms of speciation in the Giliopsis
   group of Ipomopsis (Polemoniaceae), we examined patterns of
   morphological and genetic differentiation and crossability. This group
   comprises three species that diverged very recently: two perennials, I.
   guttata and I. tenuifolia, and one annual, I. effusa. Analysis of
   phenotypic variation established that the three species are distinct for
   floral characters, and this differentiation is maintained in,I locality
   containing both perennial Species. Next, we assessed the genealogical
   relationships with AFLPs. All sampled individuals of I. effusa Clustered
   together, a result in accord with its genetic isolation. The perennials,
   which retain interfertility, were not resolved its sister taxa. Rather,
   individuals sampled from the single I. guttata population that is
   sympatric with I. tenuifolia were genetically more similar to I.
   tenuifolia samples than they were to conspecifics. This pattern may be
   due to substantial introgression of I. tenuifolia genomic regions that
   do not contribute to floral phenotype in L guttata. Our result adds to
   Mounting evidence that plant species, as defined by morphological
   characters, are often not genomically cohesive. Taken together, our data
   warrant caution in delimiting species with genetic markers alone, and,
   importantly, suggest that selection on species-diagnostic morphological
   characters can be sufficiently strong to Counteract extensive gene flow.

AB The genetic basis of hybrid sterility can provide insight into the
   genetic and evloutionary origins of species barriers. We examine the
   genetics of hybrid incompatibility between two diploid plant species in
   the plant clade Solanum sect. Lycopersicon. Using a set of ner-isogenic
   lines (NILs) representing the wild species Solanum pennellii (formerly
   Lycopersicon pennellii) in the genetic background of the cultivated
   tomato S. lycopersicum (formerly I. esculentum), we found that hybrid
   pollen and seed infertility are each based on a modest number of loci,
   male (pollen) and other (seed) incompatibility factors are roughly
   comparable in number, and seed-infertility QTL act additively or
   recessively. These findings are remarkably consistent with our previous
   analysis in a different species pair, S. lycopersicum X S.
   harbroachaites. Data from both studies contrast strongly with data from
   Drosophila. Finally, QTL for pollen and seed sterility from the two
   Solanum studies were chromosomally colocalized, indicating a shared
   evolutionary history for these QTL, a nonrandom genomic distribution of
   loci causing sterility, and/or a proclivity of certain genes to be
   involved in hybrid sterility. We show that comparative mapping data can
   delimit the probable timing of evolution of detected QTL and discern
   which sterility loci likely evolved earliest among species.

AB Environmental variation is widely viewed as a major force driving
   morphological change and speciation. Although many environmental
   attributes are potentially critical for adaptive responses within and
   between species, the individual and relative importance of these diverse
   attributes remain poorly understood. Here we combine a geographical
   information systems (GIS)-based analysis of environmental variation with
   a multipopulation analysis of phenotypic, physiological, and genetic
   variation, to generate and test hypotheses of environmental factors
   likely driving adaptive divergence within and between two wild Andean
   plant species. First, we document large environmental differences
   between population locations of the two species, and among regions
   within species. Second, we show evidence for inter- and intraspecific
   differences in genetically based phenotypic and physiological variation.
   Third, combining these data, we report evidence for trait-environment
   associations both among populations within species, and between species,
   that are strongly indicative of recent and rapid adaptive responses.
   Finally, we show that these trait-environment associations cannot be
   simply explained by genetic relatedness within species, reinforcing our
   inference that local, regional, and species-wide environmental
   conditions are responsible for phenotypic and physiological
   diversification. The strongest trait-environment associations involve
   temperature and precipitation gradients, suggesting these climatic
   factors are predominant drivers of adaptive diversification in these
   species.

AB Biological factors involved in reproductive barriers between two

   germination rates, and transmission ratio distortion (TRD) of 729 RFLPs,
   AFLPs, and isozyme markers distributed across the genome on the basis of
   hybrid populations of 488 doubled haploid lines (DHLs) and 168 F-2's.
   Substantial reproductive barriers were found between the parental races,
   predominantly in the form of spore inviability (23.7% F-1 spore
   viability). Intrinsic genetic factors such as Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller
   (BDM) incompatibilities involving both nuclear-nuclear and
   nuclear-cytoplasmic factors and chromosomal rearrangements appear to
   contribute to intrinsic postzygotic isolation. The genomewide
   distribution patterns of TRD loci support the hypothesis that
   reproductive barriers are a byproduct of divergence in allopatry and
   that the strong reproductive barriers are attributable to a small number
   of genetic elements scattered throughout the genome.

AB Four members of the alpha-tubulin gene family were examined in
   Ceratopteris richardii. Genetic linkage mapping based on a population of
   nearly 500 Doubled Haploid Lines was able to position three or four
   members of this gene family on linkage groups 17, 24, and 28,
   respectively (two of the four observed polymorphic restriction fragments
   containing alpha-tubulin genes are either identical or map too close to
   each other on linkage group 17 to be distinguishable in map distance).
   Non-mapable monomorphic bands observed on probed Southern blots suggest
   that the alpha-tubulin gene family in this species is large. Four
   alpha-tubulin genes from C. richardii were sequenced and found to be
   fairly similar to each other in terms of their amino acid sequences,
   with their greatest diversity at the carboxy-terminal ends. BLAST
   comparisons found each of these four amino acid sequences more similar
   to an alpha-tubulin from a dicot, gymnosperm, or alga species than it
   was to any other alpha-tubulin sequence presently known from
   Ceratopteris or from the fern Anemia phyllitidis or the moss
   Physcornitrella patens. Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of nucleotide
   sequences placed three of the four Ceratopteris alpha-tubulin gene
   copies in a clade with copies from Pseadotsaoa and Anemia, consistent
   with a history of two gene duplication events, one following and one
   preceding the divergence of ferns and seed plants. The fourth copy is
   robustly separated from the preceding three and placed in a clade of
   algal alpha-tubulin genes, suggesting its divergence from the ancestor
   of the other three before the divergence of algae and land plants. As
   characterized thus far, the alpha-tuhulin gene family of C. richardii is
   relatively large as compared to the six copies known from fully
   sequenced Arabidopsis thaliana, a condition that may be correlated with
   the large genorne size and diverse life history constraints of this
   homosporous fern species. These findings suggest several new
   opportunities for research into the evolution. function, and regulation
   of the alpha-tubulin gene family in Ceratopteris.

AB GaN nanocolumns were grown with AIN buffer layers on (0 0 0 1) sapphire
   substrates by rf-plasma-assisted molecular-beam epitaxy. The AIN buffer
   layers underneath the nanocolumns were used to nucleate the
   nanocrystals. The thickness of the AIN buffer layer affected the column
   configuration (size, shape), the density and the optical properties of
   the nanocolumns; when the thickness increased from 1.8 to 8.2 nm, the
   average column diameter gradually decreased from 150 to 52 nm with a
   small kink, but the column density peaked at a thickness of 3.2 nm at 5
   x 10(9) cm(-2) and finally decreased to 2 x 10(8) cm(-2). Based on TEM
   observations, it is suggested that GaN nanocolumns were not grown just
   on AIN grain but on the edge of AIN grain. Further, the growth behavior
   of a nanocolumn as a function of AIN buffer layer thickness is
   suggested. The room-temperature photoluminescence intensity of the
   nanocolumns was maximized at a buffer thickness of 4.6 nm, where the
   intensity was 4 times stronger than that of high-quality bulk GaN
   crystals grown by HVPE with a threading dislocation density of similar

AB Homosporous ferns have extremely high chromosome numbers relative to
   flowering plants, but the species with the lowest chromosome numbers
   show gene expression patterns typical of diploid organisms, suggesting
   that they may be diploidized ancient polyploids. To investigate the role
   of polyploidy in fern genome evolution, and to provide permanent genetic
   resources for this neglected group, we constructed a high-resolution
   genetic linkage map of the homosporous fern model species, Ceratoptefis
   richardii (n = 39). Linkage map construction employed 488 doubled
   haploid lines (DHLs) that were genotyped for 368 RFLP, 358 AFLP, and 3
   isozyme markers. Forty-one linkage groups were recovered, with average
   spacing between markers of 3.18 cM. Most loci (similar to 76%) are
   duplicated and most duplicates occur on different linkage groups,
   indicating that as in other eukaryotic genomes, gene duplication plays a
   prominent role in shaping the architecture of fern genomes. Although
   past polyploidization is a potential mechanism for the observed
   abundance of gene duplicates, a wide range in the number of gene
   duplicates as well as the absence of large syntenic regions consisting
   of duplicated gene copies implies that small-scale duplications may be
   the primary mode of gene duplication in C. richardii. Alternatively,
   evidence of past polyploidization(s) may be masked by extensive
   chromosomal rearrangements as well as smaller-scale duplications and
   deletions following polyploidization(s).

AB New species may arise via hybridization and without a change in ploidy.
   This process, termed homoploid hybrid speciation, is theoretically
   difficult because it requires the development of reproductive barriers
   in sympatry or parapatry. Theory suggests that isolation may arise
   through rapid karyotypic evolution and/or ecological divergence of
   hybrid neospecies. Here, we investigate the role of karyotypic change in
   homoploid hybrid speciation by generating detailed genetic linkage maps
   for three hybrid sunflower species, Helianthus anomalus, H. deserticola,
   and H. paradoxus, and comparing these maps to those previously generated
   for the parental species, H. annuus and H. petiolaris. We also conduct a
   quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis of pollen fertility in a BC2
   population between the parental species and assess levels of pollen and
   seed fertility in all cross-combinations of the hybrid and parental
   species. The three hybrid species are massively divergent from their
   parental species in karyotype; gene order differences were observed for
   between 9 and 11 linkage groups (of 17 total), depending on the
   comparison. About one-third of the karyoypic differences arose through
   the sorting of chromosomal rearrangements that differentiate the
   parental species, but the remainder appear to have arisen de novo (six
   breakages/six fusions in H. anomalus, four breakages/three fusions in H.
   deserticola, and five breakages/five fusions in H. paradoxus). QTL
   analyses indicate that the karyotypic differences contribute to
   reproductive isolation. Nine of 11 pollen viability QTL occur on
   rearranged chromosomes and all but one map close to a rearrangement
   breakpoint. Finally, pollen and seed fertility estimates for F-1's
   between the hybrid and parental species fall below 11%, which is
   sufficient for evolutionary independence of the hybrid neospecies.

   map of the Helianthus petiolaris genome and used it, along with an
   integrated SSR genetic linkage map derived from four independent H.
   annuus mapping populations, to examine the evolution of genome structure
   between these two annual sunflower species. The results of this work
   indicate the presence of 27 colinear segments resulting from a minimum
   of eight translocations and three inversions. These 11 rearrangements
   are more than previously suspected on the basis of either cytological or
   genetic map-based analyses. Taken together, these rearrangements
   required a minimum of 20 chromosomal breakages/fusions. On the basis of
   estimates of the time since divergence of these two species
   (750,000-1,000,000 years), this translates into an estimated rate of
   5.5-7.3 chromosomal rearrangements per million years of evolution, the
   highest rate reported for any taxonomic group to date.

AB Hybridization is frequent in many organismal groups, but its role in
   adaptation is poorly understood. In sunflowers, species found in the
   most extreme habitats are ancient hybrids, and new gene combinations
   generated by hybridization are speculated to have contributed to
   ecological divergence. This possibility was tested through phenotypic
   and genomic comparisons of ancient and synthetic hybrids. Most trait
   differences in ancient hybrids could be recreated by complementary gene
   action in synthetic hybrids and were favored by selection. The same
   combinations of parental chromosomal segments required to generate
   extreme phenotypes in synthetic hybrids also occurred in ancient
   hybrids. Thus, hybridization facilitated ecological divergence in

AB Anogramma is a genus of eight putative species with small annual
   sporophytes and potentially perennating gametophytes. Phylogenetic
   relationships within the genus as well as its relationships with other
   putatively taenitidoid genera and with traditionally cheilanthoid
   Cosentinia vellea have been poorly resolved and are investigated here.
   Maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian inference analyses
   of rbcL sequences were used to test 1) the monophyly of Anogramma, 2)
   support for the proposed specific distinctness of A. guatemalensis and
   A. caespitosa from A. leptophylla, and 3) the asserted close (sister)
   relationship between Anogramma and Pityrogramma, as well as to infer the
   phylogenetic relationships among these genera. Results reveal that
   Anogramma in the traditional sense is polyphyletic. Anogramma
   guatemalensis and A. caespitosa nest within A. leptophylla. Pityrogramma
   is not sister to Anogramma as a whole but only to A. chaerophylla and A.
   novogaliciana. Anogramma osteniana is deeply separated from its
   traditional congeners and the new combination Jamesonia osteniana
   (Dutra) Gastony is made. Cosentinia vellea should not be subsumed within
   Cheilanthes but instead should be considered a taenitidoid genus closely
   related to A. leptophylla and A. lorentzii. Neighbor joining analysis of
   Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism data sets inferred relationships
   among the A. leptophylla accessions, embedding A. guatemalensis and A.
   caespitosa in respective New World and Old World clades of A.
   leptophylla.
