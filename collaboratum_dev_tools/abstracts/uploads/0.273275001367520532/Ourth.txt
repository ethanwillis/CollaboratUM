AB Mannose-binding C-type lectin (MBL) was purified by mannan-agarose
   affinity chromatography from blue catfish D + B (Ictalurus furcatus) and
   channel catfish NWAC 103 (Ictalurus punctatus) sera. The MBLs of blue
   catfish D + B and channel catfish NWAC 103 strains have not been
   purified by affinity chromatography, characterized and quantified. The
   affinity-purified and 2-ME reduced catfish MBLs showed one band of 66
   kDa for blue catfish D + B, and one band of 63 kDa for channel catfish
   NWAC 103 by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Amino acid composition
   analysis (mol%) of the isolated catfish MBLs was done. The amount of
   methionine-S present in blue catfish D + B (0.78 mol%) was 2.2-times
   greater when compared with channel catfish NWAC 103 (0.35 mol%). The
   amount of proline present was 1.9-times greater in channel catfish NWAC
   103 (8.0 mol%) when compared with blue catfish D + B (4.3 mol%).
   Tyrosine (2.5 mol%) was present in blue catfish D + B but not detected
   in channel catfish NWAC 103. N-terminal amino acid sequencing by Edman
   degradation for the first 10 residues gave two amino acid sequences of
   XRQPESFRIV and XXEDGYGKMF that were identical for both blue catfish D +
   B and channel catfish NWAC 103. This could represent the presence of two
   different isoforms of catfish MBL. Blue catfish D + B had 21.3 mu g of
   MBL/ml of serum. Channel catfish NWAC 103 (#1 serum pool) had 15.1 mu g
   of MBL/ml of serum (obtained in late Fall season), and channel catfish
   NWAC 103 (#2 serum pool) had 10.2 mu g of MBL/ml of serum (obtained in
   Spring season). A seasonal variation in the channel catfish serum MBL
   was therefore seen. A standard curve for mu g/ml of MBL in catfish serum
   was constructed with these data. The presence of MBL in blue catfish D +
   B and channel catfish NWAC 103 sera should be important in their innate
   immunity and resistance to Edwardsiella ictaluri and other microbial
   infections. This study describes the presence of MBL in these two
   Ictalurus species and evidence for a C-type lectin complement pathway of
   innate immunity. The channel catfish is used in aquaculture in the
   Southeast USA and is susceptible to bacterial infections acquired from
   its pond environment. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB New anticancer drugs are needed to support cancer treatment. Cancer
   involves the uncontrolled proliferation of tumor cells, and many
   anticancer drugs are agents that inhibit tumor cell growth. The
   antitumor cell N-myristoylated-peptide is a natural product purified
   from Heliothis virescens insect hemolymph with essentially no
   cytotoxicity against human foreskin fibroblast cells. A synthesized
   structure of six amino acids (Myristoyl-Cys-Ala-Val-Ala-Tyr-[3 methyl]
   His-OMe; M. W. 902.2 Da) was screened at 10 mu M for in vitro antitumor
   activity against 56 human tumor cell lines by the National Cancer
   Institute (NCI). The NCI found that 34 of the 56 tumor cell lines
   (representing eight major tumor types) were sensitive (> 50% growth
   inhibition of tumor cells) to the myristoylated-peptide. The best
   overall antitumor activities (> 60% average growth inhibition) were seen
   against 17 tumor cell lines for non-small cell lung cancer, leukemia and
   melanoma and for eight other tumor cell lines. The NCI finds that their
   in vitro screen is an effective selector of compounds with in vivo
   antitumor activity. (C) 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

   foreskin fibroblast cells. A (3 methyl only) version (M.W. 902.2 Da) of
   the structure was synthesized and tested for in vitro anti-EBV activity
   and cytotoxicity. The N-terminal end is lipophilic and used to get the
   compound across the cell membrane. The C-terminal end with its
   ring-shaped structures is likely used to inhibit DNA synthesis. The
   synthetic compound inhibited DNA synthesis/replication of EBV in Akata
   cells (B-lymphocyte from Burkitt's lymphoma patient) in in vitro tissue
   culture. A DNA hybridization assay for anti-EBV activity using the Akata
   B-cell and two cytotoxicity assays using human foreskin fibroblast cells
   were done with the synthetic peptide. Effective concentration (EC90) at
   20 mu M inhibited viral replication by 90%. The EBV, known as Human
   Herpesvirus-4 (HHV-4) of the Herpesviridae family, has been described as
   a cancer-promoting double-stranded DNA virus that may also be involved
   in autoimmune disease. There are no antiviral drugs in clinical use for

AB The sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) belongs to the most primitive class
   of fish and has only innate immunity. The innate immune factors,
   lysozyme and an antifungal peptide, were isolated from sea lamprey
   plasma. Sea lamprey plasma (40.1 mg protein/ml) was assayed for lysozyme
   activity by gel diffusion assay. Using hen egg white lysozyme standards,
   plasma concentration of lamprey lysozyme was 5 mu g lysozyme/mg total
   protein. The presence of lysozyme in such high concentration in lamprey
   plasma could be important in their innate immunity and resistance to
   infection. Lysozyme and the antifungal peptide were isolated by low
   molecular weight gel filtration chromatography from sea lamprey plasma.
   Gel filtration chromatography yielded two peak tubes containing lysozyme
   (1 mu g/211 mu g total protein) and antifungal peptide (1 mu g/66 mu g
   total protein). Lysozyme and antifungal activity of each fraction were
   determined by well diffusion assay using Gram-negative bacteria,
   Gram-positive bacteria and two fungal species. The molecular weight of
   lamprey lysozyme was 14.3 kDa. The sea lamprey lysozyme was effective
   against Gram-positive bacteria but not against Gram-negative bacteria or
   fungi. Molecular weight of the antifungal peptide was approximately 3000
   Da. Antifungal plasma activity was seen against Penicillium notatum and
   Aspergillus flavus. No plasma antibacterial peptide was found. (C) 2009

   of the North American Great Lakes and a predator of many bony fish
   species of commercial importance to the fishing industry.
   Mannose-binding C-type lectin (MBL) was isolated by mannanagarose
   affinity chromatography from sea lamprey plasma. Mannose-binding lectin
   has not before been identified and quantitated in the plasma of this sea
   lamprey species. The affinity-purified and 2-ME reduced lamprey MBL
   showed two bands of 35 kDa and 65 kDa by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting
   using guinea pig anti-MBL IgG as the primary antibody. Amino acid
   composition analysis (mol%) of the purified lamprey MBL found high
   amounts of histidine, threonine, tyrosine and phenylalanine present when
   compared with three other vertebrate MBLs. N-terminal amino acid
   sequencing by Edman degradation for the first 10 residues gave
   XXXTKGCPDA. Lamprey plasma contained 261 mu g of MBL/ml of plasma.
   Plasma protein concentration was 40.1 mg/ml. Lamprey MBL was present
   then in plasma at 6.5 mu g MBL/mg total protein. The sea lamprey MBL
   also specifically binds to mannose on the surface of the pathogen
   Aeromonas salmonicida. The presence of MBL in high concentration in

   catfish MBL found a high content of serine present. Functional binding
   studies of channel catfish and blue catfish MBLs binding to Edwardsiella
   ictaluri were done using a dot-immunoblot ELISA method. A dot-immunoblot

AB Mannose-binding C-type lectin (MBL) is an important component of innate
   immunity in mammals. Mannose-binding lectin (MBL), an acute phase
   protein, acts as an opsonin for phagocytosis and also activates the
   mannan-binding lectin complement pathway. It may play a particularly
   significant role during infancy before adequate specific protection can
   be provided by the adaptive immune system. Ureaplasma urealyticum has
   been linked to several diseases including pneumonia and chronic lung
   disease (CLD) in premature infants. We therefore investigated the
   ability of U. urealyticum to bind MBL. A guinea pig IgG anti-rabbit-MBL
   antiserum was produced. An immunoblot (dot-blot) assay done on
   nitrocellulose membrane determined that the anti-MBL antibody had
   specificity against both rabbit and human MBL. Pure cultures of U.
   urealyticum, serotype 3, were used to make slide preparations. The
   slides containing the organisms were then incubated with nonimmune
   rabbit serum containing MBL. Ureaplasma was shown to bind rabbit MBL
   with an immunocytochemical assay using the guinea pig IgG anti-rabbit
   MBL antiserum. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled anti-guinea pig IgG
   was used to localize the reaction. The anti-MBL antiserum was also used
   in an immunocytochemical assay to localize U. urealyticum in
   histological sections of lungs from mice specifically infected with this
   organism. The same method also indicated binding of MBL by ureaplasma in
   human lung tissue obtained at autopsy from culture positive infants. Our
   results demonstrate that ureaplasma has the capacity to bind MBL. The
   absence of MBL may play a role in the predisposition of diseases related
   to this organism. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB An insect antiviral compound was purified from Heliothis virescens
   larval hemolymph by gel-filtration high pressure liquid chromatography
   (HPLC) and C-18 reverse-phase HPLC and its structure was determined by
   mass spectrometry. The antiviral compound is an N-myristoylated-peptide
   containing six amino acids with calculated molecular weight of 916 Da.
   The N-terminus contains the fatty acid myristoyl, and the C-terminus
   contains histidine with two methyl groups giving the histidine a
   permanent positive charge. The remainder of the compound is essentially
   non-polar. The structure of the compound corresponds with the 'myristate
   plus basic' motif expressed by certain viral proteins in their binding
   to the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane to initiate viral
   assembly and budding from a host cell. The insect antiviral compound may
   inhibit viral assembly and/or budding of viruses from host cells that
   could include the human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) and herpes
   simplex virus-1 that use this motif for exit from a host cell. Using the
   formazan assay, the myristoylated-peptide was effective against HIV-1,

   treated CEM-SS cells when compared with infected but untreated control
   cells. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) is extensively used in
   aquaculture in the Southeast US and is susceptible to many bacterial
   infections acquired from its pond environment. Research is needed to
   better understand the defensive response and innate immunity of channel
   catfish against fish pathogens like Edivardsiella ictaluri and Aeromonas
   hydrophila. The main objectives were purification and characterization
   of an innate antimicrobial factor isolated from catfish leucocytes that
   has both bactericidal and antiviral activities. Oxygen-independent
   mechanisms of innate immunity for killing microorganisms have not been
   identified in leucocytes of channel catfish. Leucocytes were separated
   from catfish blood, and granule extracts were obtained by
   homogenization, centrifugation, and extraction with 10% acetic acid. The
   granule extracts were further purified by gel filtration chromatography.
   Bactericidal assays against the two fish pathogens and SDS-PAGE analysis
   were done on the isolated antimicrobial factor. Determination of
   antiviral activity of the factor was done by in vitro tissue culture
   using herpes simplex virus-type 1. Mass spectrometry analyses were done
   for molecular weight (655 Da), purity, and structural characterization
   of the innate non-peptide antimicrobial factor. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

AB Ureaplasma urealyticum is a common inhabitant of mucosal surfaces but is
   also associated with a higher incidence of pneumonia and
   bronchopulmonary dysplasia in preterm infants. Culture and polymerase
   chain reaction demonstrate high isolation rates of ureaplasma in
   clinical specimens documenting their presence but do not associate the
   organism directly with the diseased tissue. In this study, lung tissue
   samples from newborn mice inoculated intranasally with U. urealyticum
   were used to develop an in situ hybridization (ISH) test for the
   organism. In situ hybridization allows the localization of gene
   expression for visualization within the context of tissue morphology.
   New techniques which use biotinyl-tyramide based signal amplification
   have been able to greatly enhance the sensitivity of ISH. Using the Dako
   GenPoint Catalyzed Signal Amplification system to detect a biotinylated
   DNA probe specific for an internal nucleotide sequence within the urease
   gene of U. urealyticum, the organism was detected within the infected
   murine lung tissues. Electron microscopy was used to verify the presence
   of the organisms in the positive ISH areas. The ISH procedure developed
   in this study can be used to analyze the presence of ureaplasma in human
   neonatal lung tissue with the corresponding histopathology. (C) 2003

AB Infants with Ureaplasma urealyticum in the lower respiratory tract are
   at risk for chronic lung disease (CLD) or bronchopulmonary dysplasia
   (BPD) but causality has been difficult to prove. The goal of this study
   was to identify ureaplasma in human neonatal lung tissue using the in
   situ hybridization (ISH) procedure described in Part I (Exp. Mol.
   Pathol., in press) of this report. By correlating their presence with
   the histopathologic findings. it may be possible to provide further
   evidence of the pathogenicity of ureaplasmas and their association with
   BPD. Lung autopsy tissue from seven infants with positive cultures and
   seven infants with negative cultures for ureaplasma were included in the
   study. All culture-positive infants were positive for ureaplasma on ISH
   and all had histopathologic evidence of BPD. Two of the seven infants
   with negative cultures were positive for ureaplasma with ISH. Of
   interest, these two infants were also found to have BPD at autopsy. The
   other five infants with negative cultures were also negative for
   ureaplasma on ISH and had no evidence of BPD. This study correlates the
   presence of U. urealylticum by ISH with the finding of BPD on
   histopathologic evaluation and provides evidence that it has a role in
   the development of CLD. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights

   sequence confirmed the protein as ApoLp-III with homology of 56-83% to
   other insect ApoLp-III molecules. The amino acid spatial arrangement of
   the predicted a-helix I of Heliothis ApoLp-III was nearly identical to
   that of the amphipatic alpha-helix 1 of Manduca sexta ApoLp-III. The
   absorption spectrum from 240-340 nm of the Heliothis ApoLp-III was the
   same as the UV spectra of ApoLp-III from Manduca sexta and Galleria
   mellonella, showing absorption maxima at 280, 268, 264 and 259 nm. These
   results indicated that the primary structure of ApoLp-III is conserved
   in lepidopterans. The Heliothis ApoLp-III was not a glycoprotein and
   showed hem agglutination activity against rabbit red blood cells. This
   hemagglutination activity was abolished by Tween 80, but not by six
   different carbohydrates. Hydrophobic interaction of Apol-p-III with red
   blood cells agreed with structural studies since ApoLp-III binds lipid
   through hydrophobic interaction after conformational change. Bacterial
   injection apparently increased the amount of ApoLp-III in immune
   hemolymph when compared with normal hemolymph, and may indicate that
   ApoLpIII plays a role in insect immunity. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

   hemolymph increased as greatly as did lysozyme activity of the immune
   larval hemolymph after metamorphosis. The pupal immune response with
   regard to lysozyme was much greater than the larval immune response in
   H. virescens. Lysozyme was purified by heat treatment at 100 degrees C
   and a chromatography series that included reverse-phase HPLC. The
   molecular mass of H, virescens lysozyme was approximately 16 kDa by
   SDS-PAGE which is greater than other insect lysozymes and chicken
   lysozyme. Amino acid sequence of the N-terminus showed that H. virescens
   lysozyme is 82% homologous with lysozyme of Manduca sexta and Galleria
   mellonella. CNBr cleavage of H. virescens lysozyme produced 11 and 6 kDa
   peptide fragments indicating that one methionine was present, which was
   also supported by amino acid analysis. However, methionine was located
   at the carboxyl terminal side rather than the N-terminal side as judged
   by the N-terminal sequences of each peptide fragment. The residue 22 in
   most lepidopteran lysozymes is methionine, whereas H. virescens lysozyme
   had a leucine at residue 22. There was an amino acid deletion near the
   carboxyl terminal side of H. virescens lysozyme as also found in
   Trichoplusia ni. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We have recently characterized specific binding sites for human
   interferon-gamma on particulates prepared from the protocerebrum and
   hemolymph of tobacco hornworm larvae, Manduca sexta {(Parker, M.S.,
   Ourth, D.D., 1999. Comp. Biochem, Physiol. B 122, 155-163). The
   sensitivity to sulfated polysaccharides indicated an involvement of
   oligobasic epitopes of hIFN-gamma in the binding. In the present study,
   we found that polycationic peptides inhibited the binding of
   [I-125]hIFN-gamma to particulates from either the hemolymph or the
   protocerebrum of Manduca sexta larvae. With amino acid homopolymers, the
   rank order of potency was poly-L-lysine > poly-L-arginine >>
   poly-L-ornithine, while the acidic side chain polymer poly-L-aspartate
   was not inhibitory. However, the potency of all polycationic peptides
   was at least three-fold greater at the hemolymph particulates. Also,
   acidic polysaccharides such as heparin were much more efficacious in the
   inhibition of hIFN-gamma binding to hemolymph relative to protocerebral
   particulates. The peptide polycations inhibited the binding of
   [I-125](Leu(31),Pro(34))human peptide YY, a ligand selective for the Y-1
   subtype of the neuropeptide Y receptor, to rabbit kidney or to parietal
   cortex particulates with the expected rank order of poly-L-arginine >
   poly-L-lysine >> poly-L-ornithine, and with little cross-tissue
   difference in affinity. The selectivity observed with M. sexta
   particulates indicates a preferential involvement of oligobasic
   lysine-rich C-terminal sequences of IFN-gamma, while large insect
   tissue-related affinity differences point to involvement of diverse
   oligoacidic sequences in binding to protocerebrum and hemolymph sites.
   This study provides evidence for the presence of molecules in
   lepidopteran larvae that are similar in structure to vertebrate
   co-receptors of IFN-gamma, and adds to the characterization of these
   binding sites. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Immune hemolymph was collected from fifth instar larvae and 1-day-old
   pupae of Heliothis virescens after injection of prepupae with live
   Enterobacter cloacae. Induction of antibacterial activity against
   Escherichia coli K12 D31 was 7.5 times greater in pupal than in larval
   immune hemolymph. Lysozyme activity of immune pupal hemolymph against
   Micrococcus lysodeikticus was Il times greater when compared with
   lysozyme activity of immune larval hemolymph. Early pupal immune
   response with regard to antibacterial activity was much greater than
   larval immune response in H, virescens. Normal pupal hemolymph showed an
   increase in antibacterial activity and lysozyme that was induced during
   metamorphosis. Antibacterial protein was isolated together with lysozyme
   by gel filtration chromatography and then separated from lysozyme by
   sequential electrophoresis with a native acid gel and SDS gel. Molecular
   mass of antibacterial protein was estimated to be 12 kDa. The N-terminal
   amino acid sequence of 12-kDa protein was different from those of
   antibacterial molecules found in other insects and has not been
   identified before. A sample containing 12-kDa protein was negative for
   immunoblotting with anti-synthetic cecropin B antibody. We have named
   the novel 12-kDa antibacterial protein viresin. Viresin showed
   antibacterial activity against several Gram-negative bacteria including
   E. cloacae but not against Gram-positive bacteria.

AB Specific binding sites for human interferon-gamma (hIFN-gamma) were
   found on particulates prepared from the hemolymph and protocerebrum of
   fifth-instar larvae of the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta. A portion of
   these sites could be solubilized in an active form by the zwitterionic
   detergent 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propane sulfonate
   (CHAPS). A well-defined specific binding was also associated with
   hemolymph particulate residue after solubilization by CHAPS. About
   one-half of [I-125]hIFN-gamma binding could be displaced by heparin. The
   bound hIFN-gamma could be covalently cross-linked to the binding sites
   using disuccinylamide suberate, and the molecular weight range of these
   complexes was 200-800 kDa as determined by density gradient
   sedimentation and gel-exclusion chromatography. Only a small fraction of
   the hemolymph IFN-gamma binding could be competed by another mammalian
   cytokine, rat prolactin (rPRL), while there was no sensitivity to rat
   growth hormone. The small specific rPRL binding found in Manduca
   hemolymph showed an affinity similar to the prolactin sites found in the
   liver of pregnant rats. The detergent-insoluble Manduca hIFN-gamma
   binding was bimodal and similar in affinity distribution to the binding
   found with human platelet membranes (K-diss range 0.1-2 nM). The
   detergent-solubilized IFN-gamma sites were homogenous, with a K-diss of
   about 1.5 nM. The IFN-gamma binding sites in Manduca tissues may
   therefore include molecular species similar to the known invertebrate
   cytokine receptors and proteoglycan co-receptors. (C) 1999 Elsevier

AB Lysozyme is an important antibacterial protein in the insect defense
   system. Lysozyme was isolated from hemolymph of Heliothis virescens
   larvae using gel filtration and ion-exchange chromatography. Heliothis
   lysozyme had a molecular mass of 16,000 daltons by SDS-PAGE. Using acid
   gel electrophoresis, Heliothis lysozyme migrated faster than egg white
   lysozyme. The pi of Heliothis lysozyme was estimated as greater than
   9.5. Heliothis lysozyme had specific bactericidal activity against three
   Gram-positive bacteria but no activity against Escherichia coil. The
   bactericidal activity was stable at 100 degrees C at pH 3.0 after 60 min
   incubation, but was labile at 100 degrees C at pH 6.8 after 60 min
   incubation. Heliothis lysozyme was an inducible protein that increased 9
   times when comparing unvaccinated with vaccinated larvae. Lysozyme from
   H. virescens was more similar in molecular mass, heat sensitivity and pH
   sensitivity to lysozyme isolated from Galleria mellonella and Bombyx
   mori than to lysozyme isolated from Hyalophora cecropia. (C) 1996

AB The insect humoral defense system produces antibacterial peptides called
   cecropins. Cecropins were initially isolated from Hyalophora cecropia
   pupae and have since been isolated and identified in various insects. In
   this study, we have isolated and identified a cecropin from Heliothis
   virescens larvae. Rabbit IgG were raised against synthetic cecropin B.
   Affinity chromatography with the rabbit anti-(cecropin B) IgG was used
   to isolate a cecropin from hemolymph of H. virescens larvae. Acid gel
   electrophoresis followed by a bacterial-overlay analysis showed that
   Heliothis cecropin is a basic peptide of low molecular mass with
   bactericidal activity against Escherichia coli K12 D31. Heliothis
   cecropin is therefore analogous to synthetic cecropin B. One unresolved
   issue concerning cecropins and other antibiotic peptides is the mode of
   action by which they kill bacteria. By means of electron microscopy and
   immunocytochemistry with gold-labeled rabbit anti-cecropin IgG, binding
   of purified and synthetic cecropin to the cell membranes of E. coli K12
   D31 cells was observed. Small lesions in the cell membrane were seen
   that had a diameter of 9.6 nm and internal pore of 4.2 nm. The Heliothis
   cecropin was found to be a pore-forming molecule that causes lesions in
   the cell membrane of E. coli K12 D31. The lesions lead to leakage of
   cytoplasmic contents and death of bacteria.

AB Inducible cecropin-like and attacin-like proteins were isolated from
   immune hemolymph obtained from vaccinated Heliothis virescens larvae.
   The attacin-like protein had a molecular weight of approximately 25,000
   daltons and was not dialyzable. The cecropin-like peptide had an
   estimated molecular weight of 6,000-7,000 daltons and was dialyzable,
   heat-stable and sensitive to trypsin digestion. The cecropin-like
   peptide showed bactericidal activity against Escherichia coli and
   Enterobacter cloacae, and the attacin-like protein showed bactericidal
   activity against E. coli. The immune hemolymph was bactericidal against
   E. coli, E. cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Ultrastructural cell
   envelope damage to E. coil, produced by the immune hemolymph, was
   observed by scanning electron microscopy. No antiviral activity by the
   inducible cecropin-like and attacin-like proteins was detected against
   herpes simplex virus-1 and the vesicular stomatitis virus. (C) 1994

   (ACP) on neutrophil and monocyte phagocytes from peripheral blood of
   channel catfish, Ictalurus punctatus. Fluorescent-labeled latex
   microspheres, Edwardsiella ictaluri and Escherichia coli were used to
   quantify phagocytic attachment and ingestion. Activation of the ACP
   enhanced the attachment of bacteria and microspheres to neutrophils and
   monocytes. Activation of the ACP by serum opsonization of Esherichia
   coil increased its ingestion by neutrophils in comparison with
   Edwaidsiella ictaluri and microspheres. Inactivation of the ACP and C3b
   diminished attachment by neutrophils and monocytes, and ingestion by
   neutrophils of microspheres and bacteria. Ingestion by monocytes was not
   affected by activation of the ACP. In the present study, we found that
   the ACP functions in opsonophagocytosis in catfish and that ingestion by
   neutrophils was especially enhanced.
