AB RL95-2 endometrial cancer cells were used to study cytochrome
   P450-mediated chemopreventative mechanisms of four flavonoids found in
   foods. To investigate enzymatic CYP1 inhibition, intact cells were
   induced with benzo(a)pyrene or 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin.
   Quercetin, kaempferol and myricetin inhibited CYP1 activity
   dose-dependently with IC(50)s ranging from 2.2 to 4 mu M; while
   amentoflavone was inactive. Further experiments were designed to
   determine if flavonoids also interacted with the AhR or caused a
   decrease in CYP1 protein or mRNA expression. CYP1A1 protein expression
   was inhibited in cells co-treated with TCDD and quercetin, kaempferol or
   myricetin compared with TCDD alone, but amentoflavone was ineffective.
   Relatively higher (similar to 7-fold) basal levels of CYP1B1 protein
   were not significantly affected by flavonoid treatments. In general, at
   the message level significant inhibition of induced CYP1A1 or CYP1B1 was
   not detected following flavonoid cotreatment. Despite the common
   inhibitory effects of quercetin, kaempferol, and myricetin on induced
   CYP1A1-dependent activity and protein expression, the mechanisms of CYP1
   inhibition in this cell line are complex and dependent on the CYP gene,
   AhR inducer and the flavonoid. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   doi:10.1152/physiolgenomics.00176.2011.-Keratinocyte terminal
   differentiation is the process that ultimately forms the epidermal
   barrier that is essential for mammalian survival. This process is
   controlled, in part, by signal transduction and gene expression
   mechanisms, and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is known to
   be an important regulator of multiple epidermal functions. Using
   microarray analysis of a confluent cell density-induced model of
   keratinocyte differentiation, we identified 2,676 genes that are
   regulated by epidermal growth factor (EGF), a ligand of the EGFR. We
   further discovered, and separately confirmed by functional assays, that
   EGFR activation abrogates all of the known essential processes of
   keratinocyte differentiation by 1) decreasing the expression of lipid
   matrix biosynthetic enzymes, 2) regulating numerous genes forming the
   cornified envelope, and 3) suppressing the expression of tight junction
   proteins. In organotypic cultures of skin, EGF acted to impair epidermal
   barrier integrity, as shown by increased transepidermal water loss. As
   defective epidermal differentiation and disruption of barrier function
   are primary features of many human skin diseases, we used bioinformatic
   analyses to identify genes that are known to be associated with skin
   diseases. Compared with non-EGF-regulated genes, EGF-regulated genes
   were significantly enriched for skin disease genes. These results
   provide a systems-level understanding of the actions of EGFR signaling
   to inhibit keratinocyte differentiation, providing new insight into the
   role of EGFR imbalance in skin pathogenesis.

AB Chloracne is commonly observed in people exposed to dioxins, yet the
   mechanism of toxicity is not well understood. The pathology of chloracne
   is characterized by hyperkeratinization of the interfollicular squamous
   epithelium, hyperproliferation and hyperkeratinization of hair follicle
   cells as well as a metaplastic response of the ductular sebum secreting
   sebaceous glands. In vitro studies using normal human epidermal
   keratinocytes to model interfollicular human epidermis demonstrate a
   2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD)-mediated acceleration of
   differentiation and increase in gene expression of several
   prodifferentiation genes, including filaggrin (FLG). Here, we
   demonstrated that the TCDD-activated aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR)
   bound a small fragment of DNA upstream of the transcriptional start
   sites of the FLG gene, containing one of two candidate xenobiotic
   response elements (XREs). Reporter assays using the promoter region of
   FLG containing the two putative XREs indicated that the increase in this
   messenger RNA (mRNA) was due to TCDD-mediated enhanced transcription,
   which was lost when both XREs were mutated. As FLG is part of the human
   epidermal differentiation complex (EDC) found on chromosome 1, we
   measured mRNAs from an additional 18 EDC genes for their regulation by
   TCDD. Of these genes, 14 were increased by TCDD. Immunoblot assays
   demonstrated that the proteins of FLG as well as that of another
   prodifferentiation gene, small proline rich protein 2, were increased by
   TCDD. In utero exposure to TCDD accelerated the formation of the
   epidermal barrier in the developing mouse fetus by approximately 1 day.
   These results indicate that the epidermal permeability barrier is a
   functional target of the TCDD-activated AHR.

AB Aldo-keto reductase-7A (AKR7A) is an enzyme important for bioactivation
   and biodetoxification. Previous studies suggested that Akr7a might be
   transcriptionally regulated by oxidative stress-responsive transcription
   factor nuclear factor erythroid 2 p45-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a protein
   highly responsive to acetaminophen (APAP) or its intermediate
   metabolite, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinoneimine (NAPQI). This study was,
   therefore, carried out to investigate whether Akr7a is involved in the
   protection against APAP-induced oxidative stress and hepatotoxicity. We
   found that in response to APAP or NAPQI exposure, Akr7a3 mRNA and
   protein were significantly up-regulated in vitro in human HepG2 and LO2
   cells. Similarly, strong induction was observed for Akr7a5 in mouse
   AML12 hepatocytes exposed to APAP. In vivo in wild-type rats,
   significant up-regulation of hepatic AKR7A1 protein was observed after
   administration of APAP. On the other hand, depletion of Nrf2 reduced the
   expression of Akr7a3, suggesting that Nrf2, indeed, contributes
   significantly to the induction of Akr7a. Moreover, loss of cell
   viability in Nrf2-depleted cells was significantly rescued by
   coexpression of AKR7A3. Furthermore, increased AKR7A3 in HepG2 cells was
   associated with the up-regulation of oxidative stress-related enzymes to
   enhance cellular antioxidant defense, which appeared to contribute
   significantly to protection against APAP-induced toxicity. In a line of
   transgenic rats overexpressing AKR7A1, increased AKR7A1 stimulated the
   expression of Nrf2 and other Nrf2-regulated genes, but did not better
   protect rats from APAP insults. In contrast, depletion of Akr7a5 in
   vitro in cultured AML12 cells or depletion of Akr7a1 in vivo in rat
   liver greatly increased APAP-induced hepatotoxicity. Conclusion: AKR7A
   proteins are significantly up-regulated in response to APAP/NAPQI
   exposure to contribute significantly to protection against APAP-induced
   hepatotoxicity. AKR7A mediates this protection, in part, through
   enhancing hepatocellular antioxidant defense. (HEPATOLOGY

AB The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae transcription factor Yap1 mediates an
   adaptive response to oxidative stress by regulating protective genes.
   H2O2 activates Yap1 through the Gpx3-Mediated formation of a Yap1
   Cys303-Cys598 intramolecular disulfide bond. Thiol-reactive
   electrophiles can activate Yap1 directly by adduction to cysteine
   residues in the C-terminal domain containing Cys598, Cys620, and Cys629.
   H2O2 and N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) showed no cross-protection against each
   other, whereas another thiol-reactive chemical, acrolein, elicited
   Yap1-dependent cross-protection against NEM, but not H2O2. Either Cys620
   or Cys629 was sufficient for activation of Yap1 by NEM or acrolein;
   Cys598 was dispensable for this activation mechanism. To determine
   whether Yap1 activated by H2O2 or thiol-reactive chemicals elicits
   distinct adaptive gene responses, microarray analysis was performed on
   the wild-type strain or its isogenic single-deletion strain Delta yap1
   treated with control buffer, H2O2, NEM, or acrolein. Sixty-five unique
   H2O2 and 327 NEM and acrolein Yap1-dependent responsive genes were
   identified. Functional analysis using single-gene-deletion yeast strains
   demonstrated that protection was conferred by CTA1 and CTT1 in the
   H2O2-responsive subset and YDR042C in the NEM- and acrolein-responsive
   subset. These findings demonstrate that the distinct mechanisms of Yap1
   activation by H2O2 or thiol-reactive chemicals result in selective
   expression of protective genes. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights

AB Reports indicate that toxic equivalency factors (TEFs) based primarily
   on rodent data do not accurately predict in vitro human responsiveness
   to certain dioxin-like chemicals (DLCs). To investigate this in cells
   responsive to dioxins and relevant to chloracne, normal human epidermal
   keratinocytes were treated with 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin
   (TCDD) and several DLCs, each with a TEF value of 0.1, representing
   three classes of congeners. We estimated half maximal effective
   concentration (EC50)-based donor-specific relative potency (REP) values
   for cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) messenger RNA (mRNA) induction for
   TCDD, 1,2,3,6,7,8-hexachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (HxCDD),
   2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzofuran (TCDF),
   1,2,3,6,7,8-hexachlorodibenzofuran (HxCDF), and
   3,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB 126). We also determined EC50-based
   population-level REP values (n = 4) for CYP1A1 mRNA induction for TCDD,
   HxCDF, and PCB 126. Furthermore, an alternative factor, the relative
   threshold factor (RTF) based on the low end (threshold) of the
   dose-response curve, was calculated. Our results demonstrated that HxCDF
   had a population-based REP value of 0.98, 9.8-fold higher than its
   assigned TEF value of 0.1. Conversely, PCB 126 had an REP value of
   0.0027 and an RTF of 0.0022, 37-fold and 45-fold less than its assigned
   TEF of 0.1, respectively. The REP values for HxCDD and TCDF were 0.24
   and 0.10, respectively, similar to their assigned value of 0.1.
   Therefore, although the DLCs tested in the current study all possessed
   the same assigned TEF value of 0.1, congener-specific differences in
   REPs and RTFs were observed for human keratinocytes. These
   congener-specific discrepancies are likely because of differences in
   interspecies factors that have yet to be defined.

AB Toxicogenomics has great potential for enhancing our understanding of
   environmental chemical toxicity, hopefully leading to better informed
   human health risk assessments. This study employed toxicogenomic
   technology to reveal species differences in response to two prototypical
   aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) agonists
   2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin and the polychlorinated biphenyl
   (PCB) congener PCB 126. Dose-responses of primary cultures of rat and
   human hepatocytes were determined using species-specific microarrays
   sharing over 4000 gene orthologs. Forty-seven human and 79 rat genes
   satisfied dose-response criteria for both chemicals and were subjected
   to further analysis including the calculation of the 50% effective
   concentration and the relative potency (REP) of PCB 126 for each gene.
   Only five responsive orthologous genes were shared between the two
   species; yet, the geometric mean of the REPs for all rat and human
   modeled responsive genes were 0.06 (95% confidence interval [CI];
   0.03-0.1) and 0.002 (95% CI; 0.001-0.005), respectively, suggesting
   broad species differences in the initial events that follow AHR
   activation but precede toxicity. This indicates that there are species
   differences in both the specific genes that responded and the agonist
   potency and REP for those genes. This observed insensitivity of human
   cells to PCB 126 is consistent with more traditional measurements of AHR
   activation (i.e., cytochrome P450 1A1 enzyme activity) and suggests that
   the species difference in PCB 126 sensitivity is likely due to certain
   aspects of AHR function. That a species divergence also exists in this
   expanded AHR-regulated gene repertoire is a novel finding and should
   help when extrapolating animal data to humans.

AB Loss of NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling increases susceptibility
   to acute toxicity, inflammation and carcinogenesis in mice due to the
   inability to mount adaptive responses. In contrast, disruption of Keap1
   (a cytoplasmic modifier of Nrf2 turnover) protects against these
   stresses in mice, although inactivating mutations in Keap1 have been
   identified recently in some human cancers. Global characterization of
   Nrf2 activation is important to exploit this pathway for chemoprevention
   in healthy, yet at-risk individuals and also to elucidate the
   consequences of hijacking the pathway in Keap1-mutant human cancers.
   Liver-targeted conditional Keap1-null, Albumin-Cre:Keap1((flox/-)) (CKO)
   mice provide a model of genetic activation of Nrf2 signaling. By
   coupling global gene expression analysis of CKO mice with analysis of
   pharmacologic activation using the synthetic oleanane triterpenoid
   1-[2-cyano-3,12-dioxooleana-1,9(11)-dien-28-oyl]imidazole (CDDO-Im), we
   are able to gain insight into pathways affected by Nrf2 activation.
   CDDO-Im is an extremely potent activator of Nrf2 signaling. CKO mice
   were used to identify genes modulated by genetic activation of Nrf2
   signaling. The CKO response was compared with hepatic global gene
   expression changes in wild-type mice treated with CDDO-Im at a maximal
   Nrf2 activating dose. The results show that genetic and pharmacologic
   activation of Nrf2 signaling modulates pathways beyond detoxication and
   cytoprotection, with the largest cluster of genes associated with lipid
   metabolism. Genetic activation of Nrf2 results in much larger numbers of
   detoxication and lipid metabolism gene changes. Additionally, analysis
   of pharmacologic activation suggests that Nrf2 is the primary mediator
   of CDDO-Im activity, though other cell-signaling targets are also
   modulated following an oral dose of 30 mu mol/kg.

AB In both experimental animals and humans, aflatoxin B-1 (AFB(1)) is a
   potent hepatic toxin and carcinogen against which a variety of
   antioxidants and experimental or therapeutic drugs (e.g., oltipraz,
   related dithiolethiones, and various triterpenoids) protect from both
   acute toxicity and carcinogenesis. These agents induce several hepatic
   glutathione S-transferases (GST) as well as aldo-keto reductases (AKR)
   which are thought to contribute to protection. Studies were undertaken
   in transgenic rats to examine the role of one inducible enzyme, AKR7A1,
   for protection against acute and chronic actions of AFB(1) by enhancing
   detoxication of a reactive metabolite, AFB(1) dialdehyde, by reduction
   to alcohols. The AFB(1) dialdehyde forms adducts with protein amino
   groups by a Schiff base mechanism and these adducts have been theorized
   to be at least one cause of the acute toxicity of AFB(1) and to enhance
   carcinogenesis. A liver-specific AKR7A1 transgenic rat was constructed
   in the Sprague-Dawley strain and two lines, AKR7A1(Tg2) and AKR7A1(Tg5),
   were found to overexpress AKR7A1 by 18- and 8-fold, respectively. Rates
   of formation of AFB(1) alcohols, both in hepatic cytosols and as urinary
   excretion products, increased in the transgenic lines with AKR7A1(Tg2)
   being the highest. Neither line offered protection against acute
   AFB(1)-induced bile duct proliferation, a functional assessment of acute
   hepatotoxicity by AFB(1), nor did they protect against the formation of
   GST-P positive putative preneoplastic foci as a result of chronic
   exposure to AFB(1). These results imply that the prevention of protein
   adducts mediated by AKR are not critical to protection against AFB(1)
   tumorigenicity.

AB Dioxin is an extremely potent carcinogen. In highly exposed people, the
   most commonly observed toxicity is chloracne, a pathological response of
   the skin. Most of the effects of dioxin are attributed to its activation
   of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), a transcription factor that
   binds to the Ah receptor nuclear translocator ( ARNT) to regulate the
   transcription of numerous genes, including CYP1A1 and CYP1B1. In
   cultures of normal human epidermal keratinocytes dioxin accelerates cell
   differentiation, as measured by the formation of cornified envelopes. We
   show that this acceleration is mediated by the AHR; also, that dioxin
   increases the expression of several genes known to be regulated by ARNT,
   which have critical roles in the cornification and epidermal barrier
   function of the skin. Importantly, we demonstrate that all of these
   responses are opposed by ligand-activation of the EGF receptor ( R), an
   important regulator of keratinocyte cell fate. In the CYP1A1 enhancer,
   EGFR activation prevents recruitment of the p300 coactivator, although
   not affecting the binding of the AHR or ARNT. The total cellular level
   of p300 protein does not decrease, and overexpression of p300 relieves
   EGFR-mediated repression of transcription, indicating that p300 is a
   critical target for the repression of the AHR complex by EGFR signaling.
   These results provide a mechanism by which
   2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin is able to disrupt epidermal
   homeostasis and identify EGFR signaling as a regulator of the AHR. This
   signaling may modulate the incidence and severity of chloracne and be of
   therapeutic relevance to human poisonings by dioxin.

AB 3H-1,2-dithiole-3-thione (D3T) and its analogues
   4-methyl-5-pyrazinyl-3H-1,2-dithiole-3-thione (OLT) and
   5-tert-butyl-3H-1,2-dithiole-3-thione (TBD) are chemopreventive agents
   that block or diminish early stages of carcinogenesis by inducing
   activities of detoxication enzymes. While OLT has been used in clinical
   trials, TBD has been shown to be more efficacious and possibly less
   toxic than OLT in animals. Here, we utilize a robust and high-resolution
   chemical genomics procedure to examine the pharmacological
   structure-activity relationships of these compounds in livers of male
   rats by microarray analyses. We identified 226 differentially expressed
   genes that were common to all treatments. Functional analysis identified
   the relation of these genes to glutathione metabolism and the nuclear
   factor, erythroid derived 2-related factor 2 pathway (Nrf2) that is
   known to regulate many of the protective actions of dithiolethiones. OLT
   and TBD were shown to have similar efficacies and both were weaker than
   D3T. In addition, we identified 40 genes whose responses were common to
   OLT and TBD, yet distinct from D3T. As inhibition of cytochrome P450
   (CYP) has been associated with the effects of OLT on CYP expression, we
   determined the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) values for
   inhibition of CYP1A2. The rank order of inhibitor potency was OLT > TBD
   > D3T, with IC(50) values estimated as 0.2, 12.8 and > 100 mu M,
   respectively. Functional analysis revealed that OLT and TBD, in addition
   to their effects on CYP, modulate liver lipid metabolism, especially
   fatty acids. Together, these findings provide new insight into the
   actions of clinically relevant and lead dithiolethione analogues.

AB Post hoc assignment of patterns determined by all pairwise comparisons
   in microarray experiments with multiple treatments has been proven to be
   useful in assessing treatment effects. We propose the usage of
   transitive directed acyclic graphs (tDAG) as the representation of these
   patterns and show that such representation can be useful in clustering
   treatment effects, annotating existing clustering methods, and analyzing
   sample sizes. Advantages of this approach include: (1) unique and
   descriptive meaning of each cluster in terms of how genes respond to all
   pairs of treatments; (2) insensitivity of the observed patterns to the
   number of genes analyzed; and (3) a combinatorial perspective to address
   the sample size problem by observing the rate of contractible tDAG as
   the number of replicates increases. The advantages and overall utility
   of the method in elaborating drug structure activity relationships are
   exemplified in a controlled study with real and simulated data.

AB The reduction of the aflatoxin B-1 (AFB(1)) dialdehyde metabolite to its
   corresponding mono and dialcohols, catalyzed by aflatoxin B-1 -aldehyde
   reductase (AFAR, rat AKR7A1, and human AKR7A3), is greatly increased in
   livers of rats treated with numerous chemoprotective agents. Recombinant
   human AKR7A3 has been shown to reduce the AFB(1)-dialdehyde at rates
   greater than those of the rat AKR7A1. The activity of AKR7A1 or AKR7A3
   may detoxify the AFB(1)-dialdehyde, which reacts with proteins, and
   thereby inhibits AFB(1)-induced toxicity; however, direct experimental
   evidence of this hypothesis was lacking. Two human B lymphoblastoid cell
   lines, designated pMF6/1A2/AKR7A1 and pMF6/1A2, were genetically
   engineered to stably express AKR7A1 and/or cytochrome P4501A2 (1A2). The
   pMF6/1A2/AKR7A1 cells were refractory to the cytotoxic effects of 3
   ng/mL AFB(1), in comparison to pM6/ 1A2 cells, which were more
   sensitive. Diminished protection occurred at higher concentrations of
   AFB(1) in pMF6/1A2/AKR7A1 cells, suggesting that additional factors were
   influencing cell survival. COS-7 cells were transfected with either
   vector control, rat AKR7A1, or human AKR7A3, and the cells were treated
   with AFB(1) -dialdehyde. There was a 6-fold increase in the dialdehyde
   LC50, from 66 mu M in vector-transfected cells to 400 mu M in
   AKR7A1-transfected cells, and an 8.5-fold increase from 35 mu M in
   vectortransfected cells to 300 mu M in AKR7A3-transfected cells. In both
   cases, this protective effect of the AFAR enzyme was accompanied by a
   marked decrease in protein adducts. Fractionation of the cellular
   protein showed that the mitochondria/nuclei and microsomal fractions
   contained the highest concentration of protein adducts. The levels of
   human AKR7A3 and AKR7A2 were measured in 12 human liver samples. The
   expression of AKR7A3 was detectable in all livers and lower than those
   of AKR7A2 in 11 of the 12 samples. Overall, these results provide the
   first direct evidence of a role for rat AKR7A1 and human AKR7A3 in
   protection against AFB(1)-induced cytotoxicity and protein adduct
   formation.

AB CYP1B1 and CYP19 ( aromatase) have been shown to be expressed in breast
   tumors. Both enzymes are efficient estrogen hydroxylases, indicating the
   potential for overlapping substrate and inhibitor specificity. We
   measured the inhibition properties of aromatase inhibitors (AIs) against
   CYP1B1-catalyzed hydroxylation of 17 beta-estradiol (E2) to determine
   whether CYP1B1 affects the disposition of AIs. In addition, we estimated
   the frequency of coexpression of these enzymes in breast tumor
   epithelium. Immunohistochemical analyses of CYP19 and CYP1B1 in a panel
   of 29 cases of invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast showed epithelial
   cell staining for CYP19 in 76% and for CYP1B1 in 97% of the samples.
   Statistical analysis showed no significant correlation (0.33) for
   positive expression of CYP19 and CYP1B1 ( p > 0.07). CYP1B1 inhibition
   was determined for two steroidal inhibitors: formestane and exemestane
   and five nonsteroidal inhibitors: aminoglutethimide, fadrozole,
   anastrozole, letrozole, and vorozole. Of the seven compounds tested,
   only vorozole exhibited inhibition of CYP1B1 activity with IC50 values
   of 17 and 21 mu M for 4-hydroxy estradiol and 2-hydroxy estradiol,
   respectively. The estimated K-i values of vorozole for E2 4- and
   2-hydroxylation were 7.26 and 6.84 mu M, respectively.
   Spectrophotometric studies showed that vorozole was a type II inhibitor
   of CYP1B1. This study shows that with the exception of vorozole, the
   aromatase inhibitors are selective for CYP19 relative to CYP1B1. Thus,
   although both CYP19 and CYP1B1 are expressed in a high percentage of
   breast cancers, CYP1B1 is not a major determinant of the disposition of
   AIs.

AB Chronic exposure of Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats to either
   2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin ( TCDD) or Aroclor 1254 results in
   female-selective induction of hepatic tumors. The relative potency of
   dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyl mixtures, such as Aroclor 1254, is
   often estimated using the internationally endorsed toxic equivalency
   (TEQ) approach. Comparing the genome wide changes in gene expression in
   both genders following exposure to TEQ doses of these chemicals should
   identify critical sets of early response genes while further defining
   the concept of the TEQ of halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons. Aroclor
   1254 at 0.6,6.0, and 60 mg/kg body weight and TEQ doses of TCDD (0.3 and
   3.0 mu g/kg), calculated to match the top two Aroclor 1254 doses, were
   orally administered to SD rats for three consecutive days. Day 4 gene
   expression in hepatic tissue was determined using microarrays. A linear
   mixed-effects statistical model was developed to analyze the data in
   relation to treatment, gender, and gender * treatment (G*T)
   interactions. The genes most changed included 54 genes with and 51 genes
   without a significant model G*T term. The known aryl hydrocarbon
   receptor (AHR) battery genes (Cyp1a1, Cyp1a2, Cyp1b1, Aldh3a1), and
   novel genes, responded in a TEQ dose-dependent manner in both genders.
   However, an important observation was the apparent disruption of
   sexually dimorphic basal gene expression, particularly for female rats.
   Because many of these genes are involved in steroid metabolism, exposure
   to either TCDD or Aroclor 1254 could disrupt proliferative signals more
   in female rats as a possible consequence of altered estrogen metabolism.
   This study extends the findings of previous rodent bioassays by
   identifying groups of genes, other than the well-characterized AHR
   response genes, whose disruption may be important in the tumorigenic
   mechanism in this rat strain.

AB The aflatoxin B-1 aldehyde reductases (AFARs), inducible members of the
   aldo-keto reductase superfamily, convert aflatoxin B-1 dialdehyde
   derived from the exo- and endo-8,9-epoxides into a number of reduced
   alcohol products that might be less capable of forming covalent adducts
   with proteins. An isotope dilution tandem mass spectrometry method for
   quantification of the metabolites, C-8 monoalcohol, dialcohol, and C-6a
   monoalcohol, was developed to ascertain their possible role as urinary
   biomarkers for application to chemoprevention investigations. This
   method uses a novel C-13(17)-aflatoxin B-1 dialcohol internal standard,
   synthesized from C-13(17)-aflatoxin B-1 biologically produced by
   Aspergillus flavus. Chromatographic standards of the alcohols were
   generated through sodium borohydride reduction of the aflatoxin B-1
   dialdehyde. This method was then explored for sensitivity and
   specificity in urine samples of aflatoxin B-1-dosed rats that were
   pretreated with 3H-1,2-dithiole-3-thione to induce the expression of
   AKR7A1, a rat isoform of AFAR. One of the two known monoalcohols and the
   dialcohol metabolite were detected in all urine samples. The
   concentrations were 203.5 +/- 39.0 ng of monoalcohol C-6a/mg of urinary
   creatinine and 10.0 +/- 1.0 ng of dialcohol/mg of creatinine (mean +/-
   standard error). These levels represented about 8.0 and 0.4% of the
   administered aflatoxin B-1 dose that was found in the urine at 24 h,
   respectively. Thus, this highly sensitive and specific isotope dilution
   method is applicable to in vivo quantification of urinary alcohol
   products produced by AFAR. Heretofore, the metabolic fate of the
   8,9-epoxides that are critical for aflatoxin toxicities has been
   measured by biomarkers of lysine-albumin adducts, hepatic and urinary
   DNA adducts, and urinary mercapturic acids. This urinary detection of
   the alcohol products directly contributes to the goal of mass balancing
   the fate of the bioreactive 8,9-epoxides of AFB(1) in vivo.

   differences in gene expression between the bed nucleus of the stria

   using microarray analysis. We first tested for differences in expression
   of genes encoding transcripts for common neurotransmitter systems as
   well as calcium binding proteins routinely used in neuroanatomical
   delineation of brain regions. This a priori method revealed differential
   expression of corticotropin releasing hormone (Crh), the GABA
   transporter (Slc6a1), and prodynorphin (Pdyn) mRNAs as well as several
   others. Using a gene ontology tool, functional scoring analysis, and
   Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, we further identified several physiological
   pathways that were distinct among these brain regions. These two
   different analyses both identified calcium signaling, G-coupled protein
   receptor signaling, and adenylate cyclase-related signaling as
   significantly different among the BNST, NAc, and dStr. These types of
   signaling pathways play important roles in, amongst other things,
   synaptic plasticity. Investigation of differential gene expression
   revealed several instances that may provide insight into reported
   differences in synaptic plasticity between these brain regions. The
   results support other studies suggesting that crucial pathways involved
   in neurotransmission are distinct among the BNST, NAc, and dStr and
   provide insight into the potential use of pharmacological agents that
   may target region-specific signaling pathways. Furthermore, these
   studies provide a framework for future mouse-mouse comparisons of

AB The estrogen dependence of breast cancer has long been recognized;
   however, the role of 17 beta-estradiol (E-2) in cancer initiation was
   not known until we showed that it induces complete neoplastic
   transformation of the human breast epithelial cells MCF-10F. E2
   treatment of MCF-10F cells progressively induced high colony efficiency
   and loss of ductulogenesis in early transformed (trMCF) cells and
   invasiveness in Matrigel invasion chambers. The cells that crossed the
   chamber membrane were collected and identified as bsMCF; their subclones
   were designated bcMCF; and the cells harvested from carcinoma formation
   in severe combined immummodeficient mice were designated caMCF. These
   phenotypes correlated with gene dysregulation during the progression of
   the transformation. The highest number of dysregulated genes was
   observed in caMCF, being slightly lower in bcMCF, and lowest in trMCF.
   This order was consistent with the extent of chromosome aberrations
   (caMCF > bcMCF >>> trMCF). Chromosomal amplifications were found in
   1p36.12-pter, 5q21.1-qter, and 13q21.31-qter. Losses of the complete
   chromosome 4 and 8p11.21-23.1 were found only in tumorigenic cells. In
   tumor-derived cell lines, additional losses were found in 3p12.1-14.1,
   9p22.1-pter, and 18q11.21qter. Functional profiling of dysregulated
   genes revealed progressive changes in the integrin signaling pathway,
   inhibition of apoptosis, acquisition of tumorigenic cell surface
   markers, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. In tumorigenic cells,
   the levels of E-cadherin, epithelial membrane antigen, and various
   keratins were low and CD44E/CD24 were negative, whereas SNAI2, vimentin,
   S100A4, FN1, HRAS, transforming growth factor 01, and CD44H were high.
   The phenotypic and genomic changes triggered by estrogen exposure that

   the expression of 17 markers by immunohistochemistry in 842 invasive
   breast carcinomas collected in a population-based case-control study
   conducted in Poland. Based on marker correlations, factor analysis
   identified four major coexpression patterns (factors): "nuclear receptor
   factor" [estrogen receptor (ER)-alpha, progesterone receptor, androgen
   receptor, cyclin D1, and aromatase], "estrogen metabolism/ER-beta
   factor" (ER-beta, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma,
   steroid sulfatase, estrogen sulfonotransferase, and cytochrome P450
   1B1), "HER2 factor" (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2,
   E-cadherin, cyclooxygenase-2, aromatase, steroid sulfatase), and
   "proliferation factor" (cytokeratin 5, cytokeratin 5/6, epidermal growth
   factor receptor, P53). Three of these factors corresponded to molecular
   subtypes previously defined by expression profiling; however, the
   estrogen metabolism/ER-beta factor seemed to be distinctive. High scores
   for this factor were associated with high tumor grade (P heterogeneity =
   0.02), younger age at menarche (P heterogeneity = 0.04), lower current
   body mass index among premenopausal women (P heterogeneity 0.01), and
   older age at menopause (P heterogeneity 0.04). High scores for the
   proliferation factor were also associated with early menarche (P
   heterogeneity < 0.0001), and in contrast to the estrogen
   metabolism/ER-beta factor, higher current body mass index among
   premenopausal women (P heterogeneity = 0.03). Our analysis of hormonal
   pathway markers independently confirmed several previously defined
   molecular subtypes identified by gene expression profiling and augmented
   these findings by suggesting the existence of additional relationships
   related to ER-beta and enzymes involved in hormone metabolism.

   2-hydroxylation was 3.7 for human CYP1B1 and 0.5 for rat CYP1B1. These
   results indicate that, although rat CYP1B1 is a low K, E2 hydroxylase,
   its product ratio, unlike the human enzyme, favors 2-hydroxylation. The
   K; values of the inhibitor 2,4,3',5'-tetramethoxystilbene (TMS) for E2
   4- and 2-hydroxylation by rat CYP1B1 were 0.69 and 0.78 mu M,
   respectively. The K; values of 7,8-benzoflavone (alpha-NF) for E2 4-and
   2-hydroxylation by rat CYP1B1 were 0.01 and 0.02 mu M, respectively. The
   knowledge gained from this study will support the rational design of
   CYP1B1 inhibitors and clarify results of CYP1B1 related carcinogenesis
   studies performed in rats. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Exposure to estrogens is associated with increased risk of breast and
   other types of human cancer. Estrogens are converted to metabolites,
   particularly the catechol estrogen-3,4-quinones (CE-3,4-Q), that can
   react with DNA to form depurinating adducts. These adducts are released
   from DNA to generate apurinic sites. Error-prone base excision repair of
   this damage may lead to the mutations that can initiate breast, prostate
   and other types of cancer.
   The reaction of CE-3,4-Q with DNA forms the depurinating adducts
   4-hydroxyestrone(estradiol) [4-OHE1(E-2)-1-N3Ade and 4-OHE1
   (E-2)-1-N7Gua. These two adducts constitute more than 99% of the total
   DNA adducts formed. Increased levels of these quinones and their
   reaction with DNA occur when estrogen metabolism is unbalanced. Such an
   imbalance is the result of overexpression of estrogen activating enzymes
   and/or deficient expression of the deactivating (protective) enzymes.
   This unbalanced metabolism has been observed in breast biopsy tissue
   from women with breast cancer, compared to control women. Recently, the
   depurinating adduct 4-OHE1(E-2)-1-N3Ade has been detected in the urine
   of prostate cancer patients, but not in urine from healthy men.
   Mutagenesis by CE-3,4-Q has been approached from two different
   perspectives: one is mutagenic activity in the lacI reporter gene in
   Fisher 344 rats and the other is study of the reporter Harvey-ras gene
   in mouse skin and rat mammary gland. A -> G and G -> A mutations have
   been observed in the mammary tissue of rats implanted with the CE-3,4-Q
   precursor, 4-OHE2. Mutations have also been observed in the Harvey-ras
   gene in mouse skin and rat mammary gland within 6-12 h after treatment
   with E-2-3,4-Q, suggesting that these mutations arise by error-prone
   base excision repair of the apurinic sites generated by the depurinating
   adducts.
   Treatment of MCF-10F cells, which are estrogen receptor-alpha-negative
   immortalized human breast epithelial cells, with E-2, 4-OHE2 or 2-OHE2
   induces their neoplastic transformation in vitro, even in the presence
   of the antiestrogen ICI-182,780. This suggests that transformation is
   independent of the estrogen receptor. The transformed cells exhibit
   specific mutations in several genes. Poorly differentiated
   adenocarcinomas develop when aggressively transformed MCF-10F cells are
   selected and injected into severe combined immune depressed (SCID) mice.
   These results represent the first in vitro/in vivo model of
   estrogen-induced carcinogenesis in human breast epithelial cells. In
   other studies, the development of mammary tumors in estrogen receptor-a
   knockout mice expressing the Wnt-1 oncogene (ERKO/Wnt-1) provides direct
   evidence that estrogens may cause breast cancer through a genotoxic,
   non-estrogen receptor-alpha-mediated mechanism. In summary, this
   evidence strongly indicates that estrogens can become endogenous tumor
   initiators when CE-3,4-Q react with DNA to form specific depurinating
   adducts. Initiated cells may be promoted by a number of processes,
   including hormone receptor stimulated proliferation. These results lay
   the groundwork for assessing risk and preventing disease. (c) 2006

AB Four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CYP1B1 (Ex2+143 C > G,
   Ex2+356 G > T, Ex3+251 G > C, Ex3+315 A > G) cause amino acid changes
   (R48G, A119S, L432V and N453S, respectively) and are associated with
   increased formation of catechol estrogens; however, epidemiologic
   evidence only weakly supports an association between these variants and
   breast cancer risk. Because genetic variability conferring increased
   susceptibility could exist beyond these putative functional variants, we
   comprehensively examined the common genetic variability within CYP1B1. A
   total of eight haplotype-tagging (ht)SNPs (including Ex3+315 A > G), in
   addition to two putatively functional SNPs (Ex2+143 C > G and Ex3 + 251
   G > C), were selected and genotyped in a large case-control study of
   Polish women (1995 cases and 2296 controls). Haplotypes were estimated
   using the expectation-maximization algorithm, and overall differences in
   the haplotype distribution between cases and controls were assessed
   using a global score test. We also evaluated levels of tumor CYP1B1
   protein expression in a subset of 841 cases by immunohistochemistry, and
   their association with genetic variants. In the Polish population, we
   observed two linkage disequilibrium (LD)-defined blocks. Neither
   haplotypes (global P-value of 0.99 and 0.67 for each block of LD,
   respectively), nor individual SNPs (including three putatively
   functional SNPs) were associated with breast cancer risk. CYP1B1 was
   expressed in most tumor tissues (98%), and the level of expression was
   not related to the studied genetic variants. We found little evidence
   for modification of the estimated effect of haplotypes or individual
   SNPs by age, family history of breast cancer, or tumor hormone receptor
   status. The present study provides strong evidence against the existence
   of a substantial overall association between common genetic variation in
   CYP1B1 and breast cancer risk.

AB Applying quantitative trait analysis methods to genome-wide
   microarray-derived mRNA expression phenotypes in segregating populations
   is a valuable tool in the attempt to link high-level traits to their
   molecular causes. The massive multiple-testing issues involved in
   analyzing these data make the correct level of confidence to place in
   mRNA abundance quantitative trait loci (QTL) a difficult problem. We use
   a unique resource to directly test mRNA abundance QTL replicability in
   mice: paired recombinant inbred (RI) and F-2 data sets derived from
   C57BL/6J (B6) and DBA/2J (D2) inbred strains and phenotyped using the
   same Affymetrix arrays. We have one forebrain and one striatum data set
   pair. We describe QTL replication at varying stringencies in these data.
   For instance, 78% of mRNA expression QTL (eQTL) with genome-wide
   adjusted p <= 0.0001 in RI data replicate at a genome-wide adjusted p <
   0.05 or better. Replicated QTL are disproportionately putatively
   cis-acting, and approximately 75% have higher apparent expression levels
   associated with B6 genotypes, which may be partly due to probe set
   generation using B6 sequence. Finally, we note that while trans-acting
   QTL do not replicate well between data sets in general, at least one
   cluster of trans-acting QTL on distal Chr 1 is notably preserved between
   data sets.

AB Cytochrome P-450s (CYPs) detoxify a wide variety of xenobiotics and
   environmental contaminants, but can also bioactivate carcinogenic
   polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, such as benzo(a)pyrene (BaP), to
   DNA-reactive species. The primary CYPs involved in the metabolism and
   bioactivation of BaP are CYP1A1 and CYP1B1. Furthermore, BaP can induce
   expression of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 via the aryl hydrocarbon receptor.
   Induction of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 by BaP in target (lung) and non-target
   (liver) tissues was investigated utilizing precision-cut rat liver and
   lung slices exposed to BaP in vitro. Tissue slices were also prepared
   from rats pretreated in vivo with 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin
   (TCDD) to induce expression of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1. In addition, in vivo
   exposure studies were performed with BaP to characterize and validate
   the use of the in vitro tissue slice model. In vitro exposure of liver
   and lung slices to BaP resulted in a concentration-dependent increase in
   CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 mRNA and protein levels, which correlated directly
   with the exposure-related increase in BaP-DNA adduct levels observed
   previously in the tissue slices [Harrigan, J.A., Vezina, C.M.,
   McGarrigle, B.P., Ersing, N., Box, H.C., Maccubbin, A.E., Olson, J.R.,
   2004. DNA adduct formation in precision-cut rat liver and lung slices
   exposed to benzo(a)pyrene. Toxicological Sciences 77, 307-314].
   Pretreatment of animals in vivo with TCDD produced a marked induction of
   CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 expression in the tissue slices, which was similar to
   the levels of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 mRNA achieved in liver and lung
   following in vivo treatment with BaP. Following in vitro exposure to
   BaP, the levels of CYP1A1 were greater in the lung than the liver, while
   following all exposures (in vitro and in vivo), the levels of CYP1B1
   mRNA were greater in lung tissue compared to liver. The higher
   expression of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 in the lung was associated with higher
   levels of BaP-DNA adducts in the lung slices (Harrigan et al.'s work)
   and together, these results may contribute to the tissue specificity of
   BaP-mediated carcinogenesis. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Septicemia is a major cause of death associated with noncoronary
   intensive care. Systemic production of nitric oxide ( NO) by inducible
   nitric- oxide synthase ( iNOS) is a major cause of hypotension and poor
   organ perfusion seen in septic shock. Here, we show that pretreatment of
   F344 rats with the cancer chemoprotective agent 3H- 1,2- dithiole- 3-
   thione ( D3T) blocks lipopolysaccharide ( LPS)- mediated induction of
   hepatic iNOS and significantly reduces the associated serum levels of NO
   metabolites and enzyme markers of toxicity provoked by treatment with
   LPS. Immunohistochemical analysis shows that this protective effect is
   largely due to suppression of iNOS expression in hepatocytes.
   Importantly, pretreatment of animals with D3T blunts LPS- mediated
   hypotension and dramatically increases their survival. Inasmuch as iNOS
   expression can be regulated by nuclear factor ( NF) kappa B, mechanistic
   studies show that D3T blocks NF kappa B nuclear translocation and DNA
   binding and that these effects are accompanied by changes in the levels
   of phospho- inhibitor of NF kappa B. In conclusion, this study
   identifies new drug classes and targets that may improve the prevention
   and treatment of septic shock, as well as chronic diseases associated
   with the NF kappa B and iNOS pathways.

AB The Toxic Equivalency Factor (TEF) approach is a methodology that
   assigns relative toxicity values to structurally related chemicals in
   comparison to a reference chemical. For the polychlorinated
   dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), the reference is the most potent congener,
   2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). Here, we critically review
   the literature on the effects of a weak PCDD,
   I,2,3,4,6,7,8,9-octachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (OCDD), and describe the
   uncertainties of assigning its TEF. PCDDs, including OCDD, are less
   potent in human cell models compared to the rat models from which the
   TEF are estimated. This lack of concordance is even more pronounced with
   the weaker congeners such as OCDD. Furthermore, OCDD is also likely to
   compete with TCDD for binding to cytochrome P4501A2 (CYP1A2),
   effectively decreasing the hepatic tissue/fat ratio of TCDD. Overall,
   the predictive value of TEFs would be improved by incorporating into
   this number the relative sensitivity of human cell responses compared to
   rodent responses, by determining the toxicological effects of altering
   the tissue distribution of dioxin-like compounds through competition for
   CYP-binding sites, and by understanding the mechanism of cancer
   causation of any dioxin and whether this mechanism is conserved in
   humans and at equivalent doses. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights

AB Synthetic triterpenoid analogues of oleanolic acid are potent inducers
   of the phase 2 response as well as inhibitors of inflammation. We show
   that the triterpenoid,
   1-[2-cyano-3-,12-dioxooleana-1,9(11)-dien-28-oyl]imidazole (CDDO-Im), is
   a highly potent chemopreventive agent that inhibits aflatoxin-induced
   tumorigenesis in rat liver. The chemopreventive potency of CDDO-Im was
   evaluated by measuring inhibition of formation of putative preneoplastic
   lesions (glutathione S-transferase P positive foci) in the liver of rats
   exposed to aflatoxin B-1. CDDO-Im produces an 85% reduction in the
   hepatic focal burden of preneoplastic lesions at 1 mu mol/kg body weight
   and a > 99% reduction at 100 mu mol/kg body weight. CDDO-Im treatment
   reduces levels of aflatoxin-DNA adducts by similar to 40% to 90% over
   the range of 1 to 100 mu mol/kg body weight. Additionally, changes in
   mRNA levels of genes involved in aflatoxin metabolism were measured in
   rat liver following a single dose of CDDO-Im. GSTA2, GSTA5, AFAR, and
   EPHX1 transcripts are elevated 6 hours following a 1 mu mol/kg body
   weight dose of CDDO-Im. Microarray analysis using wildtype and Nrf2
   knockout mice confirms that many phase 2 and antioxidant genes are
   induced in an Nrf2-dependent manner in mouse liver following treatment
   with CDDO-Im. Thus, low-micromole doses of CDDO-Im induce cytoprotective
   genes, inhibit DNA adduct formation, and dramatically block hepatic
   tumorigenesis. As a point of reference, oltipraz, an established
   modulator of aflatoxin metabolism in humans, is 100-fold weaker than
   CDDO-Im in this rat antitumorigenesis model. The unparalleled potency of
   CDDO-Im in vivo highlights the chemopreventive promise of targeting Nrf2
   pathways with triterpenoids.

AB 3H-1,2-dithiole-3thione (D3T), an inducer of antioxidant and phase 2
   genes, is known to enhance the detoxification of environmental
   carcinogens, prevent neoplasia, and elicit other protective effects.
   However, a comprehensive view of the regulatory pathways induced by this
   compound has not yet been elaborated. Fischer F344 rats were gavaged
   daily for 5 days with vehicle or D3T (0.3 mmol/ kg). The global changes
   of gene expression in liver were measured with Affymetrix RG-U34A chips.
   With the use of functional class scoring, a semi-supervised method
   exploring both the expression pattern and the functional annotation of
   the genes, the Gene Ontology classes were ranked according to the
   significance of the impact of D3T treatment. Two unexpected functional
   classes were identified for the D3T treatment, cytosolic ribosome
   constituents with 90% of those genes increased, and cholesterol
   biosynthesis with 91% of the genes repressed. In another novel approach,
   the differentially expressed genes were evaluated by the Ingenuity
   computational pathway analysis tool to identify specific regulatory
   networks and canonical pathways responsive to D3T treatment. In addition
   to the known glutathione metabolism pathway (P = 0.0011), several other
   significant pathways were also revealed, including antigen presentation
   (P = 0.000476), androgen/ estrogen biosynthesis (P = 0.000551), fatty
   acid (P = 0.000216), and tryptophan metabolism (P = 0.000331) pathways.
   These findings showed a profound impact of D3T on lipid metabolism and
   anti-inflammatory/ immune-suppressive response, indicating a broader
   cytoprotective effect of this compound than previously expected.

   chemopreventive agents, several with known action on the cytochrome P450
   1A family. We examined whether cytochrome P450 1B1 (CYP1B1) was
   inhibited by coumarins, whether such inhibition was competitive, and
   whether inhibition varied between common polymorphic variants of this
   enzyme.
   Methods We tested the inhibition properties of four coumarins,
   bergamottin, isopimpinellin, isoimperatorin, and imperatorin in an assay
   for oxidation of (-)benzo[a]pyrene-7R-trans-7,8-dihyrodiol
   (B[a]P-7,8-diol) by CYP1B1 using yeast-microsome expressed enzymes.
   These assays were performed with wild-type enzyme and five single-amino
   acid polymorphic variants.
   Results All four coumarins are competitive inhibitors of CYP1B1, with
   K-i values equal to 587, 11, 6 and 1 &mu; m respectively. Inhibition
   parameters were consistent between five haplotypes of CYP1B1, three
   representing common haplotypes in Asians, African-Americans and
   European-Americans, and two with baseline kinetic parameters previously
   shown to be potentially different from wild-type.
   Conclusions Coumarins are capable of inhibiting carcinogen activation by
   CYP1B1 with varying potencies, and their efficacy as chemopreventive
   agents is not likely to be affected by polymorphism in this enzyme.

AB Cytochromes P450 1A1 and 1B1 are known to bioactivate procarcinogens
   such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) found in cigarette smoke
   and are inducible via an Ah receptor-mediated mechanism. The aim of this

   samples of lung from smokers (n = 18), non-smokers (n = 7), and
   ex-smokers (n = 7). Using immunoglobulin preparations of highly specific
   polyclonal antibodies and immunoblot analysis of microsomes from lung
   tissues, we determined the specific content for CYP1A1 and CYP1B1. For
   CYP1A1, we found median expression levels of 15.5 pmol/mg microsomal
   protein in smokers, 6.0 pmol/mg microsomal protein in non-smokers, and
   19.0 pmol/mg microsomal protein in ex-smokers. The difference in median

   protein in non-smokers, and 4.4 pmol/mg microsomal protein in
   ex-smokers. The difference in median expression levels between
   ex-smokers and non-smokers was statistically significant. These results
   suggest that levels of expression of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 protein in lung
   tissues from smokers and ex-smokers are quantitatively greater than in
   non-smokers. By immunohistochemical analysis, we demonstrated the
   expression of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 in normal human alveolar type I and II
   cells, ciliated columnar epithelial cells lining bronchoalveolar
   airways, and alveolar macrophages. These results confirm that CYP1A1 is
   expressed in normal human lung, appears to be induced in smokers, and
   show interindividual variation; the similar characteristics of CYP1B1
   are demonstrated. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Cytochrome P450 1B1 (CYP1B1) has been shown to be important in the
   bioactivation of 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) to an adrenal
   toxin in rats. We investigated the effects of diet and stage of estrous
   cycle on CYP1B1 expression in rat adrenal glands and on DMBA metabolism
   by rat adrenal and hepatic microsomes. Female Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats
   were placed on either standard soy-containing NIH-31 rat chow or soy-
   and alfalfa-free 5K96 diet from postnatal day (PND) 21 until sacrifice
   at PND50+-5. Stage of estrous at sacrifice was assessed by vaginal
   cytology and confirmed by histological examination of the vagina.
   Dietary soy at the level present in NIH-31 diet did not affect serum
   estrogen and progesterone levels. Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed
   that CYP1B1 was exclusively expressed in the zona fasciculata and zona
   reticularis in adrenal cortex, which are the regions vulnerable to
   DMBA-induced adrenal necrosis. Adrenal CYP1B1 protein expression,
   3H-DMBA depletion, and formation of DMBA-3,4-, and -8,9-dihydrodiols by
   adrenal microsomes were greater in animals fed 5K96 diet, and the stage
   of the estrous cycle affected these parameters only in the soy-free 5K96
   diet. In hepatic microsomes, the formation of DMBA-3,4-dihydrodiol,
   7-hydroxy- and 12-hydroxy-DMBA were lower in animals fed NIH-31 diet
   than in those fed 5K96 diet. Thus, dietary soy and the estrous cycle
   appear to regulate adrenal CYP1B1 expression and DMBA metabolism by both
   adrenal and hepatic microsomes. The use of different basal diets
   containing variable levels of soy components may affect certain toxicity
   assessments.

AB Genetic differences that underlie inter-individual variation in the
   metabolism of common carcinogens are important potential sources of
   cancer susceptibility. Cytochrome P450 1B1 (CYP1B1), a central enzyme in
   the activation of the ubiquitous environmental carcinogen benzo[a]pyrene
   (B[a]P), has several genetic variants. This study investigated six rare
   mutations and four common polymorphisms for their effects on B[a]P
   metabolism. Five missense mutations associated with congenital glaucoma
   (Gly61Glu, Gly365Trp, Asp374Asn, Pro437Leu and Arg469Tryp) dramatically
   decreased the capacity of CYP1B1 to convert
   (-)benzo[a]pyrene-7R-trans-7,8-dihyrodiol (B[a]P-7,8-diol) to
   (+/-)benzo[a]pyrene-r-7,t-8-dihydrodiol-9,10-epoxides. These five
   mutations resulted in enzymes with 3-12% of normal activity when assayed
   in vitro using an Saccharomyces cerevisiae microsomal expression system.
   A 10 bp deletion mutation produced no detectable protein or activity. In
   contrast, proteins containing all possible combinations of four common
   single nucleotide polymorphisms (Arg48Gly, Ala199Ser, Val432Leu,
   Asn453Ser) had modest effects on B[a]P-7,8-diol metabolism.
   Michaelis-Menten analysis suggested that two alleles, Arg48, Ala119,
   Val432, Ser453 (RAVS) and Arg48, Ala119, Leu432, Ser453 (RALS), have K-M
   values 2-fold lower than Arg48, Ala119, Val432, Ser453 (RAVN): 1.4 +/-
   0.3 and 1.3 +/- 0.4 muM, respectively, compared with 2.8 +/- 0.8 muM (P
   < 0.05). However, these differences could not be confirmed with direct
   measurements of rate at low substrate concentration. There were no
   significant differences for either of two other kinetic parameters,
   k(cat) or k(cat)/K-M. Allele frequency analysis in three populations
   reveals the Ser453 variant is rare among those of Asian (< 1 %) and
   African ancestry (< 4 %), and more common in individuals of European
   ancestry (16%). Haplotypes containing the Ser453 variant were uncommon;
   only RALS was detectable in our small populations. The RALS allele
   occurred between 0.5% in Asians and 15 % in Europeans. Our study
   demonstrates that rare, disease-associated mutations in CYP1B1
   significantly decrease the enzyme's metabolism of B[a]P-7,8-diol;
   however, our results do not identify any major differences in this
   metabolism due to four common single amino acid polymorphisms.

AB Microarray technology has greatly aided the identification of genes that
   are expressed differentially. Statistical analysis of such data by
   multiple comparisons procedures has been slow to develop, in part,
   because methods to cluster the results of such comparisons in
   biologically meaningful ways have not been available. We isolated and
   analyzed, by Northern blot and GeneChip, replicate liver RNA samples (n
   = 4/group) from rats fed with control diet or diet containing one of
   three chemopreventive compounds, selected because their pharmacological
   activities, including RNA expression response, are relatively well
   understood. We report on a classification tree, based on the results of
   nonparametric multiple comparisons, which results in the bipolar
   hierarchical clustering of genes in relation to their response to
   treatment. In addition to identifying treatment-responsive genes,
   application of this procedure to our test study identified the known
   pharmacological relationships among the treatment groups without
   supervision. Also, small treatment-specific subsets of genes were
   identified that may be indicative of additional pharmacophores present
   in the test compounds.

AB Background and aims: A subset of colorectal carcinomas are due to a
   deficiency in the DNA mismatch repair system. The molecular mechanisms
   of tumorigenesis in these tumors is not yet well understood.
   Deregulation of the cell cycle, specifically of the G, and S phases, is
   a hallmark of human cancers. Transition from the G, to the S phase is
   accelerated by increased cyclin E protein expression, and recent studies
   suggest that overexpression of cyclin E leads to chromosomal
   instability. The overexpression of cyclin E in a variety of human
   cancers, for example in colorectal, gastric, lung, breast, and kidney
   cancer, provides evidence that cyclin E plays a pivotal role in the cell
   cycle and replication. We examined whether the overexpression of cyclin
   E is related to the status of the mismatch repair system in colorectal
   carcinomas. Patients and methods: Frozen tumor samples and adjacent
   normal colon mucosa obtained from 100 patients were subjected to
   microsatellite analysis, RT-PCR, western blot analysis and
   immunohistochemistry. Results: High microsatellite instability was
   detected in 13 tumors, and in 10 of these (77%) cyclin E protein was
   overexpressed at least twofold compared to normal mucosa. In contrast,
   only 28 of the remaining 87 microsatellite stable tumors (32%)
   overexpressed cyclin E. Lower molecular weight cyclin E proteins were
   present in 7 of 87 microsatellite stable carcinoma (8%), compared to 7
   cases exhibiting lower molecular weight isoforms of 13 MSI carcinoma
   (54%). Conclusion: Increased cyclin E protein expression and the
   appearance of lower molecular weight cyclin E proteins were
   significantly associated with MSI in colorectal tumors. The data
   indicate that increased and/or aberrant expression of cyclin E protein
   might contribute to the mutator phenotype of colorectal cancer.

AB There are several known routes for the metabolic detoxication of
   alpha,beta -unsaturated aldehydes and ketones, including conjugation to
   glutathione and reduction and oxidation of the aldehyde to an alcohol
   and a carboxylic acid, respectively. In this study, we describe a fourth
   class of detoxication that involves the reduction of the alpha,beta
   -carbon = carbon double bond to a single bond. This reaction is
   catalyzed by NAD(P)H-dependent alkenal/one oxidoreductase (AO), an
   enzyme heretofore known as leukotriene B-4 12-hydroxydehydrogenase,
   15-oxoprostagiandin 13-reductase, and dithiolethione-inducible gene-1.
   AO is shown to effectively reduce cytotoxic lipid peroxidation products
   such as 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE) (k(cat) = 4.0 x 10(3) min(-1);
   k(cat)/K-m = 3.3 x 10(7) min(-1) M-1) and acrolein (k(cat) = 2.2 x 10(2)
   min(-1); k(cat)/K-m = 1.5 x 10(6) min(-1) m(-1)) and common industrial
   compounds such as ethyl vinyl ketone (k(cat) = 9.6 x 10(3) min(-1);
   k(cat)/K-m = 8.8 x 10(7) min(-1) M-1) and 15-oxoprostaglandin E-1
   (k(cat) = 2.4 x 10(3) min(-1); k(cat)/K-m = 2.4 x 10(9) min(-1) M-1).
   Furthermore, transfection of human embryonic kidney cells with a rat
   liver AO expression vector protected these cells from challenge with
   HNE. The concentration of HNE at which 50% of the cells were killed
   after 24 h increased from similar to 15 mum in control cells to similar
   to 70 muM in AO-transfected cells. Overexpression of AO also completely
   abolished protein alkylation by HNE at all concentrations tested (up to
   30 muM). Thus, we describe a novel antioxidative activity of a
   previously characterized bioactive lipid-metabolizing enzyme that could
   prove to be therapeutically or prophylactically useful due to its high
   catalytic rate and inducibility.

AB Endometriosis is a debilitating disease estimated to affect 10% of
   reproductive-age women and characterized by the growth of endometrial
   tissue outside of the uterus. The present study characterizes a human
   endometrial explant culture model for studying the direct effects of
   TCDD exposure by assessing the expression of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 mRNA
   (Northern blotting), protein (Western blotting), and activity
   (7-ethoxyresorufln-O-deethylase; EROD) in explants cultured with and
   without TCDD. Explants were obtained at laparoscopy or laparotomy from
   women undergoing surgery for tubal ligation, endometriosis, or pelvic
   pain unrelated to endometriosis. The explants were cultured with 10 nM
   estradiol (E-2) or 1 nM E-2 plus 500 nM progesterone (P-4) with or
   without TCDD (first 24 h). The expression of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 mRNA was
   greatest with 10 nM TCDD and increased up to 72 h after initial
   exposure. EROD activity increased up to 120 h. Explants from a secretory
   phase biopsy became reorganize in culture and formed a new epithelial
   membrane, while maintaining basic endometrial morphology and viability
   for up to 120 h. At 24 h, TCDD significantly increased CYP1A1 and CYP1B1
   mRNA, and at 72 h, TCDD significantly increased EROD activity and CYP1B1
   protein compared to explants cultured without TCDD for similar times.
   CYP1B1 protein also exhibited substantial constitutive expression that
   was similar in uncultured biopsies, where CYP1B1 protein was
   immunolocalized in the cytoplasm of epithelial glands, with only
   occasional patches of protein in the surface epithelia[ membrane. In
   explants cultured with and without TCDD exposure, CYP1B1 protein was
   localized in the cytoplasm of the new surface epithelial membrane and
   glands closest to the surface. CYP1A1 protein was not detected in
   uncultured biopsies or explants. Both younger age (age 30 and under) and
   proliferative phase were associated with higher TCDD-induced EROD
   activity in specimens treated with E-2:P-4. No significant
   endometriosis-related differences were observed for any of the
   biomarkers, but the detection of disease-specific change was limited by
   small sample size and variability in tissue-cycle phase. The human
   endometrial explant culture model will be useful for future studies of
   the effects of dioxin-like,compounds on human endometrium in
   relationship to cycle phase and hormonal exposure.

AB Oxidation of the mycotoxin aflatoxin (AF) B-1 yields the 8,9-epoxide,
   which nonenzymatically hydrolyzes rapidly to a dihydrodiol that in turn
   undergoes slow, base-catalyzed ring opening to a dialdehyde [Johnson, W.
   W., Harris, T. M., and Guengerich F. P. (1996) J. Ant. Chem. Sec. 118,
   8213-8220]. AFB(1) dialdehyde does not bind to DNA but can react with
   protein lysine groups. One enzyme induced by cancer chemopreventive
   agents is AFB(1) aldehyde reductase (AFAR), which catalyzes the
   NADPH-dependent reduction of the dialdehyde to a dialcohol. AFB(1)
   dialdehyde is known to convert, nonenzymatically to AFB(1) dihydrodiol
   at neutral pH, and we reinvestigated the enzymatic reaction by preparing
   AFB(1) dialdehyde at pH 10 and then used this to initiate reactions (at
   neutral pH) with rat and human AFAR isozymes. Two monoalcohols were
   identified as products, and their identities were established by
   (NaBH4)-H-2 reduction, chemical cleavage, and mass spectrometry. The
   monoalcohol corresponding to reduction at C-8 formed first in reactions
   catalyzed by either the rat or the human AFAR. This C-8 monoalcohol was
   further reduced to AFB(1) dialcohol by AFAR. The other monoalcohol
   (C-6a) was formed but not reduced to the dialcohol rapidly. Steady-state
   kinetic parameters were Estimated for the reduction of AFB(1) dialdehyde
   by rat and human AFAR to the monoalcohols. The apparent k(cat) and K-m
   values were not adequate to rationalize the observed DeltaA(340)
   spectral changes in a kinetic model. Simulation fitting was done and
   yielded parameters indicative of greater enzyme efficiency. A survey of
   12 human liver cytosol samples showed a variation of 2.3-fold in AFAR
   activity. Rats treated with AFB(1) excreted the dialcohol and a
   monoalcohol in urine. The results of these studies are consistent with a
   role of(rat and human) AFAR in protection against AFB(1) toxicity.

AB Syrian hamsters treated with estrogen and androgen for 8 months develop
   leiomyosarcomas in the vas deferens, Metabolism of estrogen by
   cytochrome P450s (CYPs) produces catechols and reactive oxygen species,
   and may contribute to tumor formation. To examine this issue, male
   hamsters were treated with 17 beta -estradiol (E2), testosterone
   propionate (TP) or both hormones. Reproductive tract tissues from
   control and treated animals were immunostained with antibodies specific
   for four CYP enzymes (1A1, 1A2, 1B1 and 3A1/2). Immunoreactive CYP1A1
   was not found in the reproductive tract of control or treated animals.
   In untreated hamsters, CYP1A2 was detected only in principal cells of
   the caput epididymis. TP alone had no effect, but treatment with E2
   induced expression of CYP1A2 in columnar epithelial cells throughout the
   epididymis and lining of the vas deferens. Treatment with E2 + TP
   blocked the induction of CYP1A2 seen in surface epithelial cells treated
   with E2 alone, but not the constitutive expression of this enzyme.
   Instead, simultaneous exposure to both hormones induced CYP1A2 in basal
   cells of the epididymis and vas deferens, CYP3A1/2 was not detected in
   the reproductive tract of control or TP-treated males, but
   immunostaining was induced in the inner layer of vas deferens smooth
   muscle by E2, and in all smooth muscle layers by dual hormone treatment.
   In controls, CYP1B1 was present in smooth muscle lining the epididymis
   and surrounding the vas deferens and dual hormone treatment increased
   staining intensity for CYP1B1 in these cells. Immunoreactive CYP1A2 was
   not detectable in leiomyosarcomas but the enzyme was present in both
   columnar and basal cells of the vas deferens epithelium adjacent to the
   tumors. In contrast, tumor cells showed heterogeneous expression of both
   CYP1B1 and CYP3A1/2. The relationships between hormone treatment,
   differential CYP expression and tumor formation strengthen our
   hypothesis that metabolism of estrogen is an important element in this
   model of hormonal carcinogenesis.

AB Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is a rare thyroid malignancy. About
   75% are sporadic (sMTC) while the remaining 25% are hereditary (hMTC).
   The treatment of choice for both sMTC and hMTC is surgery. An adequate
   initial operation provides the best chance of cure. Hence, the diagnosis
   of MTC should be made preoperatively. In sMTC, ultrasound,
   ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology and measurement of
   calcitonin levels (basal and after injection of calcitonin-stimulating
   reagents, e.g., pentagastrin) are sensitive diagnostic tools. In hMTC,
   identification of a germline mutation in the proto-oncogene RET is
   sufficient for making the diagnosis. Total thyroidectomy is recommended
   in all patients, sporadic and hereditary. In addition, lymphadenectomy
   of the cervicocentral and both cervicolateral compartments should be
   performed. The only indication to perform a less extensive operation may
   be given in young patients with hMTC. Sufficient treatment of MTC beyond
   local disease is still nonexistent. Future research should concentrate
   on this issue.

AB Background: The induction of phase 2 enzymes by dithiolethiones such as
   oltipraz is an effective means for achieving protection against
   environmental carcinogens in animals and humans. Transcriptional control
   of the expression of at least some of these protective enzymes is
   mediated through the antioxidant response element (ARE) found in the
   upstream regulatory region of many phase 2 genes. The transcription
   factor Nrf2, which binds to the ARE, appears to be essential for the
   induction of prototypical phase 2 enzymes such as glutathione
   S-transferase (GST) Ya, Yp, and NAD(P)H: quinone reductase (NQO1) in
   vivo.
   Materials and Methods: In the present study, 3H-1,2-dithiole-3-thione
   (D3T) was used as a potent model inducer whose effects on gene
   expression and chemopreventive efficacy have been extensively
   characterized in the rat. Over a dozen putative D3T-inducible genes were
   examined in wild-type and nrf2-disrupted mice by Northern blot
   hybridization and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction
   (RT-PCR) analysis to elucidate whether loss of Nrf2 function also
   affects the induction of a broader representation of phase 2 and
   antioxidative enzymes. The effects of D3T on hepatic Nrf2 expression and
   localization were also examined in vivo by Northern blot hybridization,
   electromobility shift assay, and Western blot analysis.
   Results: Specific activities of hepatic GST and NQO1 were increased by
   D3T in wild-type mice and were largely blunted in the nrf2-deficient
   mice. However, changes in levels of RNA transcripts following D3T
   treatment of nrf2-disrupted mice were multidirectional, dependent upon
   the particular gene examined. Although elevation of mRNAs for GST Ya,
   NQO1, microsomal epoxide hydrolase and gamma -glutamylcysteine
   synthetase regulatory chain were blocked in the mutant mice, elevation
   of GST Yp mRNA was largely unimpeded. Increases in levels of mRNA for
   the heavy and light chains of ferritin were only seen in the
   nrf2-disrupted mice. Transcript levels of UDP-glucuronyl-transferase
   1A6, heme oxygenase-1, maganese superoxide dismutase, which were
   inducible in the wild-type mice, actually decreased in the mutant mice,
   whereas levels of mRNA for GST Yc, aflatoxin B-1 aldehyde reductase and
   catalase decreased following D3T treatment in the mutant mice in the
   absence of any inductive effect by D3T in the wild-type mice. In
   wild-type mice, treatment with D3T lead to 3-fold increases in hepatic
   Nrf2 mRNA levels within several hours following dosing as assessed by
   Northern blot and RT-PCR analyses. Gel shift analyses with
   oligonucleotide probes for human NQO1 ARE, murine GST Ya ARE, and
   erythroid transcription factor (NF-E2) binding site showed increased
   intensity of binding with nuclear extracts prepared from livers of
   D3T-treated mice compared to vehicle-treated controls. Antibody to Nrf2
   supershifted the DNA binding bands of these nuclear extracts. Moreover,
   immunoblot analysis indicated accumulation of Nrf2, in extracts prepared
   from hepatic nuclei of D3T-treated mice at the same time points.
   Conclusions: Nrf2 plays a central role in the regulation of constitutive
   and inducible expression of multiple phase 2 and antioxidative enzymes
   by chemoprotective dithiolethiones in vivo, although patterns of
   response vary among different genes. Knowledge of the factors
   controlling the specificity of actions of enzyme inducers will be
   exceedingly helpful in the design and isolation of more efficient and
   selective chemoprotective agents.

AB Estrogen exposure represents the major known risk factor for development
   of breast cancer in women and is implicated in the development of
   prostate cancer in men. Human breast tissue has been shown to be a site
   of oxidative metabolism of estrogen due to the presence of specific
   cytochrome P450 enzymes. The oxidative metabolism of 17beta-estradiol
   (E2) to E2-3,4-quinone metabolites by an E2-4-hydroxylase in breast
   tissue provides a rational hypothesis to explain the mammary
   carcinogenic effects of estrogen in women because this metabolite is
   directly genotoxic and can undergo redox cycling to form genotoxic
   reactive oxygen species. In this chapter, evidence in support of this
   hypothesis and of the role of P4501B1 as the 4-hydroxylase expressed in
   human breast tissue is reviewed. However, the plausibility of this
   hypothesis has been questioned on the grounds that insufficient E2 is
   present in breast tissue to be converted to biologically significant
   amounts of metabolite. This critique is based on the assumption that
   plasma and tissue E2 levels are concordant. However, breast cancer
   tissue E2 levels are 10-fold to 50-fold higher in postmenopausal women
   than predicted from plasma levels. Consequently, factors must be present
   to alter breast tissue E2 levels independently of plasma concentrations.
   One such factor may be the local production of E2 in breast tissue
   through the enzyme aromatase, and the evidence supporting the expression
   of aromatase in breast tissue is also reviewed in this chapter. If
   correct, mutations or environmental factors enhancing aromatase activity
   might result in high tissue concentrations of E2 that would likely be
   sufficient to serve as substrates for CYP1B1, given its high affinity
   for E2. This concept, if verified experimentally, would provide
   plausibility to the hypothesis that sufficient E2 may be present in
   tissue for formation of catechol metabolites that are estrogenic and
   which, upon further oxidative metabolism, form genotoxic species at
   levels that may contribute to estrogen carcinogenesis.

   expressed in Escherichia coli together with human NADPH-P450 reductase
   and the recombinant proteins (in bacterial membranes) were used to
   assess whether CYP1B1 polymorphisms affect catalytic activities towards
   a variety of P450 substrates, including diverse procarcinogens and
   steroid hormones. Activities for activation of 19 procarcinogens to
   DNA-damaging products by these four CYP1B1 variants in a Salmonella
   typhimurium NM2009 umu response system were found to be essentially
   similar, except that a Arg48, Ser119,Leu432,Asn453 variant was slightly
   more active (1.2- to 1.5-fold) than the other three CYP1B1 enzymes in
   catalyzing activation of (+)- and (-)-benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-diols,
   7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene-3,4-diol, benzo[g]chrysene-11,12-diol,

   ne, 2-amino-3-methyl-imidazo[4,5-f]quinoline and 2-aminofluorene.
   Kinetic analysis of 17 beta-estradiol hydroxylation showed that V-max
   values for 4-hydroxylation ranged between 0.9 and 1.5 nmol/min/nmol P450
   for 4-hydroxylation and 0.3 and 0.6 nmol/min/nmol P450 for
   2-hydroxylation in these CYP1B1 variants, with K-m values ranging from 1
   to 9 mu M, Interestingly, the ratio of product formation of
   4-hydroxyestradiol to 2-hydroxyestradiol was higher for the Val432
   variants of CYP1B1 variants than the Leu432 variants of the enzyme. The
   same trend was noted in the ratio of estrone 4-hydroxylation to estrone
   2-hydroxylation catalyzed by CYP1B1 variants. Mutation in the CYP1B1
   genes also affected the K-m and V-max values in the 6 beta-hydroxylation
   of testosterone and 6 beta- and 16 alpha-hydroxylation of progester-
   one. These results indicate that the polymorphisms in the human CYP1B1
   gene cause some alterations in catalytic function towards procarcinogens
   and steroid hormones and thus may make some contribution to
   susceptibilities of individuals towards mammary and lung cancers in
   humans.

   beta-estradiol (E-2) 2-hydroxylase, and P450 1B1 (CYF1B1), an E-2
   4-hydroxylase, were investigated. in HepG2 and MCF-7 cells. Elevated
   rates of 2- and 4-methoxyestradiol (2- and 4 MeOE2) formation in
   PCB-treated cultures were measured as activities of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1,
   respectively. Of the congeners investigated,
   3,4,4',5-tetrachlorobiphenyl (PCB 81), 3,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl
   (PCB 126), and 3,4',5-trichlorobiphenyl (PCB 39) caused marked
   stimulation of E-2 metabolism in both cell lines. Northern blot analyses
   confirmed that exposure of MCF-7 cells to PCBs 81, 126, and 39 caused
   highly elevated levels of the CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 mRNAs. Exposure of MCF-7
   cells to 3,3',4,4',5,5'-hexachlorobiphenyl (PCB 169) resulted in
   elevated levels of the CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 mRNAs, but did nut cause
   elevated rates of E-2 metabolism; rather, 4-MeOE2 production was
   depressed to below control levels in PCB 169-treated cultures. PCB 169
   also inhibited the 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD)-induced
   4-MeOE2 and, to a lesser extent, 2-MeOE2 production in MCF-7 cells, as
   did PCB 126 and several other congeners. In microsomal assays,
   inhibition of cDNA-expressed human CYP1B1 by PCBs 169 and 126 was
   demonstrated. These studies with one subgroup of PCBs, the non
   ortho-substituted congeners, underscore the complexity and diversity of
   effects of PCBs, as individual congeners were found both to induce

AB The aflatoxin B-1 (AFB(1)) aldehyde metabolite of AFB(1) may contribute
   to the cytotoxicity of this hepatocarcinogen via protein adduction,
   Aflatoxin B-1 aldehyde reductases, specifically the NADPH-dependent
   aldo-keto reductases of rat (AKR7A1) and human (AKR7A2), are known to
   metabolize the AFB(1) dihydrodiol by forming AFB1 dialcohol, Using a rat
   AKR7A1 cDNA, we isolated and characterized a distinct aldo-keto
   reductase (AKR7A3) from an adult human liver cDNA library. The deduced
   amino acid sequence of AKR7A3 shares 80 and 88% identity with rat AKR7A1
   and human AKR7A2, respectively. Recombinant rat AKR7A1 and human AKR7A3
   were expressed and purified from Escherichia colt as hexa-histidine
   tagged fusion proteins. These proteins catalyzed the reduction of
   several model carbonyl-containing substrates. The NADPH-dependent
   formation of AFB(1) dialcohol by recombinant human AKR7A3 was confirmed
   by liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization mass
   spectrometry, Rabbit polyclonal antibodies produced using recombinant
   rat AKR7A1 protein were shown to detect nanogram amounts of rat and
   human AKR7A protein. The amount of AKR7A-related protein in hepatic
   cytosols of 1,2-dithiole-3-thione-treated rats was 18-fold greater than
   in cytosols from untreated animals, These antibodies detected
   AKR7A-related protein in normal human liver samples ranging from 0.3 to
   0.8 mu g/mg cytosolic protein. Northern blot analysis showed varying
   levels of expression of AKR7A RNA in human liver and in several
   extrahepatic tissues, with relatively high levels in the stomach,
   pancreas, kidney and liver. Based on the kinetic parameters determined
   using recombinant human AKR7A3 and AFB(1) dihydrodiol at pH 7.4, the
   catalytic efficiency of this reaction (k(2)/K, per M/s) equals or
   exceeds those reported for other enzymes, for example cytochrome P450s
   and glutathione S-transferases, known to metabolize AFB(1) in vivo.
   These findings indicate that, depending on the extent of AFB(1)
   dihydrodiol formation, AKR7A may contribute to the protection against
   AFB(1)-induced hepatotoxicity.

   reductase cDNAs were used to identify the human P450 enzymes that are
   most active in catalyzing the oxidative transformation of benzo[a]pyrene
   in vitro. Activation of benzo[a]pyrene to genotoxic products that cause
   induction of umu gene expression in Salmonella typhimurium NM2009 by
   P450 1A1 and P450 1B1 enzymes was found to be enhanced by inclusion of
   purified epoxide hydrolase (isolated from rat or human livers) with the
   reaction mixture. High-performance liquid chromatographic analysis
   showed that P450 1B1 catalyzed benzo[a]pyrene to
   trans-7,8-dihydroxy-7,8-dihydrobenzo[a]pyrene at level of similar to 3
   nmol min(-1) nmol of P450(-1) only when epoxide hydrolase was present
   and P450 1A1 (with the hydrolase) was able to catalyze benzo[la]pyrene
   at one-tenth of the activity catalyzed by P450 1B1. Kinetic analysis
   showed that ratio of V-max to K-m for the formation of
   trans-7,8-dihydroxy-7,8-dihydrobenzo[a]pyrene in this assay system was
   3.2-fold higher in CYP1B1 than in CYP1A1. Other human P450s (including
   P450s 1A2, 2E1, and 3A4) were found to have very low or undetectable
   activities toward the formation of trans-7,8-dihydroxy-
   7,8-dihydrobenzo[a] pyrene. A reconstituted system containing purified
   P450 1B1, rabbit liver NADPH-P450 reductase, and human liver epoxide
   hydrolase was found to catalyze benzo[a]pyrene to
   trans-7,8-dihydroxy-7,8-dihydrobenzo[a]pyrene at a rate of 0.86 nmol
   min(-1) nmol of P450-1; the activities were found to be largely
   dependent on the presence of sodium cholate in the system. These results
   suggest that P450 1B1 is a principal enzyme in catalyzing the oxidation
   of benzo[a]pyrene to trans-7,8-dihydroxy-7,8-dihydrobenzo[a]pyrene and
   that the catalytic functions of P450 1B1 may determine the
   susceptibilities of individuals to benzo[a]pyrene carcinogenesis.

AB Background: In medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), the effectiveness of
   repeat mediastinal lymph-node dissection for palliation of specific
   symptoms caused by discrete mediastinal lesions is unclear in non-bulky
   tumor disease. Methods: Between November 1994 and August 1998, five
   symptomatic MTC patients with radiologic evidence of mediastinal tumor
   and elevated calcitonin levels were subjected to repeat mediastinal
   lymph-node dissection. Results: At reoperation, an average of 7 of 25
   (28%) removed cervical and 5 of 9 (56%) dissected mediastinal
   lymph-nodes were positive on histopathology. A substantial fraction of
   these were excised from anatomical regions inaccessible through a purely
   cervical or partial sternotomy approach. Clinical symptoms were
   effectively palliated in all five patients. Basal serum calcitonin
   levels fell only moderately, suggesting distant micrometastases.
   Mortality was nil. Morbidity encompassed two cases of hypoparathyroidism
   and a lymphatic fistula that closed spontaneously on total parenteral
   nutrition. One patient later required cervical reoperation deferred at
   secondary surgery. Al five patients have since remained free of cervical
   and mediastinal tumor at a mean follow-up of 15 months. Conclusions: In
   mediastinal lymph-node metastases, repeat lymph-node dissection is
   warranted for palliation of discrete anatomic lesions inaccessible
   through a cervical approach.

   in a broad spectrum of biological responses, including altered
   metabolism, disruption of normal hormone signaling pathways,
   reproductive and developmental effects, and cancer. Cytochrome P450 1B1
   (CYP1B1) is a dioxin-inducible gene that is active in the formation of
   4-hydroxyestradiol, a potentially genotoxic catechol estrogen,
   Therefore, the analysis of CYP1B1 in humans may be useful in
   establishing relationships between dioxin exposure and adverse health
   effects. In this study, we examined the expression of CYP1B1 in human
   peripheral blood lymphocytes of unexposed individuals using a
   quantitative reverse transcription-PCR method. Absolute CYP1B1 RNA
   levels varied more than 30-fold in uncultured mononuclear cells obtained
   from 10 individuals. In vitro treatment of mitogen-stimulated
   lymphocytes with TCDD for 1-5 days of culture resulted in a peak
   induction of CYP1B1 after 3 days. The induction of CYP1B1 RNA levels
   after 3 days of culture was dose-dependent, exhibited a maximum response
   above 10 nM TCDD, and varied greatly among different individuals.
   However, the half maximal dose required for this induction was similar
   between individuals and comparable to that observed in the MCF-7 and
   HepG2 human cell lines, These observations indicate that CYP1B1 exhibits
   variable constitutive expression and is inducible in vitro by TCDD in
   human lymphocytes and that the magnitude of induction varies within the
   population. These data define the suitability of CYP1B1 for use as a
   mechanistically based biomarker in ongoing molecular epidemiological
   studies of human populations exposed to dioxins and related chemicals
   that bind the aromatic hydrocarbon receptor.

   relationship between gene expression induced by TCDD and more complex
   biological responses such as altered growth, differentiation, and
   neoplasia This study investigates the dose-dependent expression of
   CYP1A1, CYP1A2, and CYP1B1 in the livers of female Sprague-Dawley rats
   chronically exposed to TCDD. Animals were treated biweekly for 30 weeks
   with daily averaged doses of 0 to 125 ng TCDD/kg/day. Immunoblot
   analysis showed that protein levels for CYP1B1, CYP1A1, and CYP1A2
   exhibited a dose-dependent induction by TCDD. However, CYP1A1 and CYP1A2
   protein levels were approximately 100-fold higher than CYP1B1, which
   could not be detected by either immunoblot analysis or
   immunohistochemistry in the livers of rats treated with TCDD for 30
   weeks at a dose-equivalent less than 35.7 ng/kg/day. In control animals,
   CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 RNA levels, measured by quantitative RT-PCR, were
   1100- and 15,000-fold higher than that of CYP1B1, respectively. TCDD
   induced CYP1B1 RNA levels at all doses, although absolute TCDD-induced
   levels of CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 at the highest dose (125 ng/kg/day) were
   more than 40-fold higher than that of CYP1B1. While the liver
   concentration of TCDD required for half-maximal induction of CYP1A1,
   CYP1A2, and CYP1B1 RNA levels was similar, the shaping parameter (Hill
   coefficient) of the dose-response curve for CYP1B1 was significantly
   higher than that for CYP1A1 or CYP1A2. The low level of TCDD-induced
   CYP1B1 expression in the liver relative to that of the CYP1A1 and CYP1A2
   suggest that, if CYP1B1 is involved in TCDD-induced
   hepatocarcinogenesis, its endogenous function is likely to be unique and
   not overlapping with that of CYP1A1 or CYP1A2. (C) 1999 Academic Press.

AB While the metabolic activation of

   N-hydroxylation has been well documented, the relative roles of the
   human cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes that catalyze this reaction have not
   been established, Previous studies indicated that the mutagenic
   activation product, 2-hydroxyamino-PhIP (N-2-OH-PhIP), is produced
   primarily by CYP1A2, and to a lesser extent by CYP1A1, We recently
   reported that human CYP1B1 also produces N-2-OH-PhIP (Carcinogenesis,
   18, 1793-1798, 1997), In the present study, we examined PhIP metabolism
   by microsomes containing recombinant human CYP1A1, 1A2 or 1B1 expressed
   in Sf9 insect cells and compared the kinetic values for PhIP metabolite
   formation. PhIP metabolites were analyzed by high pressure liquid
   chromatography with fluorescence and absorbance detection. V-max values
   for N-2-OH-PhIP formation were 90, 16 and 0.2 nmol/min/nmol P450, and
   the apparent K-m values were 79, 5.1 and 4.5 mu M for human CYP1A2, 1A1
   and 1B1, respectively. The non-mutagenic metabolite, 4'-hydroxy-PhIP,
   was also formed by all three CYP enzymes with V-max values of 1.5, 7.8
   and 0.3 nmol/min/mmol P450 and apparent K-m values of 43, 8.2 and 2.2 mu
   M for human CYP1A2, 1A1 and 1B1, respectively. Although the V-max for
   N-2-OH-PhIP production was highest for CYP1A2, the catalytic efficiency
   (V-max/K-m) of CYP1A1 was greater than that of CYP1A2, These results
   suggest that, for humans, extrahepatic CYP1A1 may be more important than
   previously thought for the metabolic activation of the dietary
   carcinogen PhIP.

   that cytochrome P450 1B1 carries out metabolism of B[a]P along the
   pathway to the postulated ultimate carcinogen, the diol epoxide 2, at
   rates much higher than P450 1A2 but less than P450 1A1, The rates of
   formation of the 7,8-diol metabolite in incubations with epoxide
   hydrolase are 0.17 and 0.38 nmol/min/nmol P450 for human P450 1B1 and
   1A1, respectively, and undetectable for 1A2, The rates of total tetrol
   metabolite formation from the 7,8-diol, which are indicative of diol
   epoxide formation, are 0.60, 0.43 and 2.58 nmol/min/nmol P450 for 1B1,
   1A2 and 1A1 respectively. In agreement with other reports of rat P450
   1B1 activity, our data show this rat enzyme to be very active for B[a]P
   and 7,8-diol, with rates higher than human P450 1B1, In addition to the
   established role of P450 1A1 in B[a]P metabolism P450 1B1 may
   significantly contribute to B[a]P and 7,8-diol metabolism and
   carcinogenesis in rodent tumor models and in humans.

AB Human cytochrome P450 (P450) 1B1 was expressed in Escherichia coli at a
   level of 200 nmol/liter culture using a pCW vector by removal of codons
   2-4 and modification of the nucleotide sequence of the resulting
   N-terminal seven codons; a similar level of expression was found with a
   bicistronic construct that also expressed human NADPH-P450 reductase,
   P450 1B1 was purified (from the monocistronic system) to electrophoretic
   homogeneity and a specific content of 9.2 nmol P450/mg protein using
   DEAE, CM, and hydroxylapatite chromatography, The absolute spectra
   showed a considerable fraction of high-spin iron and little cytochrome
   P420, The catalytic activity of the purified enzyme was considerably
   enhanced in the presence of cholate. Both reconstituted P450 1B1 and the
   bacterial membranes prepared from the bicistronic vector system had
   similar 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylation activities; as expected, 17
   beta-estradiol was hydroxylated primarily at the 4-position. The ability
   of human P450 1B1 to activate several heterocyclic amines and polycyclic
   hydrocarbon dihydrodiols was confirmed with reconstituted P450 1B1 and
   the P450 1B1 membranes in which NADPH-P450 reductase was coexpressed.

AB Cancer chemoprevention is inhibition of neoplastic disease by naturally
   occurring or synthetic chemical agents. Dithiolethiones inhibit
   production of experimentally produced tumors by elevating the expression
   of several genes that encode for known cytoprotective enzymes. In an
   effort to discover additional molecular mechanisms mediating
   chemoprevention, cDNA clones representing a gene that is
   transcriptionally activated by dithiolethiones, hence named
   dithiolethione-inducible gene-1 (DIG-1), were isolated from rat liver
   via differential hybridization screening. The deduced amino acid
   sequence of DIG-1 was found to have 80% identity with the human liver
   enzyme leukotriene B-4 (LTB4) 12-hydroxydehydrogenase. DIG-1, purified
   >400-foId from the liver of rats dosed with
   1,2-dithiole-3-dithiolethione, possessed an NADP(+)-dependent activity
   to convert LTB4 to 12-oxo-LTB4. Kinetic analysis of DIG-1 revealed
   apparent K-m and V-max values of 28 mM and 8.1 nmol 12-oxo-LTB4
   formed/min/mg purified protein respectively. Since LTB4 is a potent
   chemotactic factor and stimulator of production of reactive oxygen
   species from neutrophils, the effects of DIG-1 on these LTB4-mediated
   processes were examined. Pre-incubation of LT]B4 with purified rat
   hepatic DIG-1 greatly diminished LTB4-stimulated migration of
   neutrophils. In addition, preincubation of LTB4 with purified rat
   hepatic DIG-1 reduced LTB4-stimulated production of superoxide anions in
   neutrophils, as evidenced by decreased lucigenin-derived
   chemiluminescence. These results suggest that DIG-1-catalyzed
   dehydrogenation of LTB4 to 12-oxo-LTB4 inhibits the proinflammatory
   actions of LTB4. Consequently, elevation of LTB4 catabolism via enhanced
   DIG-1 activity may suppress inflammatory processes implicated in
   tumorigenesis.

AB Knowledge of the response of cytochrome P450 1B1 (CYP1B1) to exposure to
   2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) in both humans and rodents is
   limited. To improve the analysis of CYP1 proteins, specific CYP1B1 and
   CYP1A1 polypeptides were expressed as hexahistidine-tagged fusion
   proteins in Escherichia coli, purified to homogeneity and used to
   produce polyclonal antibodies in rabbits. Immunoblot analyses showed
   that these antibodies were specific and sensitive, detecting both the
   human and rat forms of the respective isozymes and exhibiting negligible
   cross-reactivity between the two known CYP1 subfamilies. We show that
   CYP1B1, CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 protein levels were induced in the livers of
   female Sprague-Dawley rats following either acute (single dose of 25 mu
   g TCDD/kg) or chronic (125 ng TCDD/kg/day for 30 weeks) exposure to
   TCDD, CYP1B1 protein exhibited a dose-response to TCDD that was
   different from those of CYP1A1 and CYP1A2, CYP1B1 induction appeared to
   be less sensitive to TCDD exposure, with induction occurring at higher
   doses of TCDD than that required for induction of CYP1A1 or CYP1A2.
   Immunohistochemical analysis showed that in animals chronically exposed
   to TCDD (35 ng/kg/day for 30 weeks), CYP1B1 was induced only in
   centrilobular hepatocytes, a pattern of expression similar to that of
   CYP1A1 and CYP1A2. These observations of cellular co-localization of the
   CYP1 cytochromes in livers of TCDD-treated rats and apparent differences
   in both protein amounts and dose-response are indicative of both common
   and unique regulation of CYP1 induction.

AB Human cytochromes P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) and P450 1B1 (CYP1B1) catalyze the
   metabolic activation of a number of procarcinogens and the hydroxylation
   of 17 beta-estradiol (E-2) at the C-2 and C-4 positions, respectively.
   The aromatic hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) agonist
   2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) has a marked effect on
   estrogen metabolism in MCF-7 breast-tumor cells by induction of these
   two enzymes. To investigate whether induction of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 by
   AhR agonists and the associated increase in E-2 metabolism are common to
   all breast epithelial cells and breast-tumor cells, we determined the
   effects of TCDD on E-2 metabolism, and CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 mRNA levels in
   a series of non-tumor-derived breast epithelial (184A1 and MCF-10A) and
   breast-tumor (MCF-7, T-47D, ZR-75-1, BT-20, MDA-MB-157, MDA-MB-231 and
   MB-231 and MDA-MB-436) cell lines. In 184A1 cells, which did not express
   detectable estrogen receptor (ER) a mRNA, CYP1A1 mRNA and activity were
   induced by TCDD, and enhanced E-2 metabolism in TCDD-treated cells was
   predominantly E-2 2-hydroxylation. In MCF-10A, MCF-7, T-47D, ZR-75-1 and
   BT-20 cells, which expressed varying levels of ER alpha mRNA, both
   CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 mRNA levels and rates of both E-2 2- and
   4-hydroxylation were highly elevated following exposure to TCDD, In
   MIDA-MB157, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-436 cells, which did not express
   detectable ER alpha mRNA and generally displayed fibroblastic or
   mesenchymal rather than epithelial morphology CYP1B1 induction was
   favored, and the rate of E-2 4-hydroxylation exceeded that of
   2-hydroxylation in TCDD-treated cells, These results show that breast
   epithelial cells and tumor cells vary widely with regard to AhR-mediated
   CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 induction, suggesting that factors in addition to the
   AhR regulate CYP1A1 and CYP1B2 gene expression, In these cell lines,
   significant CYP1A1 inducibility was restricted to cultures displaying
   epithelial morphology, whereas CYP1B1 inducibility was observed in cells
   of both epithelial and mesenchymal morphology.

AB The effects of synthetic chemopreventive organoselenium compounds 1,2-,

   respectively), benzyl selenocyanate (BSC), and dibenzyl diselenide (DDS)
   and inorganic sodium selenite on the oxidation of xenobiotics and
   procarcinogens by human cytochrome p450 (P450 or CYP) enzymes were
   determined in vitro. Spectral studies showed that BSC and three XSC
   compounds (but not sodium selenite or DDS) induced type II difference
   spectrum when added to the suspension of liver microsomes isolated from
   beta-naphthoflavone-treated rats, with m-XSC being the most potent in
   inducing spectral interactions with P450 enzymes; m-XSC also produced a
   type II spectral change with human liver microsomes. o-, m-, and p-XSC
   inhibited 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylation catalyzed by human liver
   microsomes when added at concentrations below 1 mu M levels, but BSC and
   DDS were less effective. All of these compounds inhibited the oxidation
   of model substrates for human P450s to varying extents. We studied the
   effects of these compounds on the activation of procarcinogens by
   recombinant human CYP1A1, 1A2, and 1B1 enzymes using Salmonella
   typhimurium NM2009 tester strain for the detection of DNA damage. The
   three XSCs were found to be very potent inhibitors of metabolic
   activation of 3-amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole,
   2-amino-3,5-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline, and 2-aminoanthracene,
   catalyzed by CYP1A1, 1A2, and 1B1, respectively. The potency of
   inhibition of m-XSC on CYP1B1-dependent activation of 2-aminoanthracene
   was compatible to those of alpha-naphthoflavone. These inhibitory
   actions my, in part, account for the mechanisms responsible for cancer
   prevention by organoselenium compounds in laboratory animals.

AB Most carcinogens require activation to electrophilic metabolites or
   species that generate reactive oxygen in order to initiate the
   tumorigenic process. These reactive intermediates can, in turn, be
   detoxified by endogenous enzyme systems that aid in the protection of
   cells from either toxic or mutagenic product formation. The levels of
   many of these enzymes are elevated by numerous compounds found in the
   diet, or by antioxidants. Recent evidence describes the mechanism for
   this induction of carcinogen detoxication enzymes to be regulated at the
   transcriptional level. Nuclear transcription factors bound to sites
   common among these carcinogen detoxication genes are activated by as yet
   unknown signal transduction pathways. The activity of these nuclear
   transcription factors are modulated by pro-and antioxidant reagents,
   suggesting that a redox-sensitive component governs the induction of
   enzymes involved in carcinogen metabolism. In this review, evidence for
   the redox regulation of the genes encoding carcinogen detoxication
   enzymes is presented. Evidence is also presented suggesting the
   participation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B), mitogen-activated
   protein (MAP) kinase, and basic leucine zipper (bZIP) proteins and their
   activation pathways in this induction. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB Cytochrome P4501B1 (CYP1B1) is the most recently identified member of
   the dioxin-inducible CYP1 family, CYP1B1 is constitutively expressed in
   most human tissues, including colon and breast, and can activate
   numerous chemically diverse carcinogens, We evaluated the metabolism of
   the dietary heterocyclic amine carcinogen
   2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) by microsomes
   from yeast expressing the human CYP1B1 protein, PhIP metabolites were
   analysed by HPLC with fluorescence and absorbance detection, We found
   that human CYP1B1 metabolizes PhIP to three products: N-2-OH-PhIP, a
   mutagenic activation product; 4'-OH-PhIP, a detoxification product; and
   2-OH-PhIP, the mutagenic potential of which is unknown, Metabolite
   identity was confirmed by coelution with authentic standards and
   synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy, The identity of the 2-OH-PhIP
   standard was additionally confirmed by mass spectrometry, Kinetic
   studies of the formation of N-2-OH-PhIP, 4'-OH-PhIP and 2-OH-PhIP by
   CYP1B1 indicated apparent K-m values of 5.7 +/- 1.3, 2.2 +/- 0.5 and 1.3
   +/- 0.2 mu M, respectively, Apparent turnover rates were 0.40 +/- 0.03,
   0.93 +/- 0.02 and 0.04 +/- 0.00 nmol product/min nmol P450,
   respectively, At saturating levels of substrate, CYP1B1-mediated
   formation of the non-mutagenic metabolite 4'-OH-PhIP was favored
   two-fold over that of the mutagenic metabolite, N-2-OH-PhIP and >10-fold
   over that of 2-OH-PhIP. The formation of N-2-OH-PhIP, a potent mutagen
   implicated in the etiology of human colon and breast cancer, indicates
   that CYP1B1 may play an important role in PhIP-mediated carcinogenesis.

AB The aquatic weevil Euhrychiopsis Lecontei is a potential control agent
   for Eurasian watermilfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum). Predation by fishes
   may influence populations of this beneficial insect. To determine if
   fish predation is an important source of mortality for E. Lecontei, fish
   stomachs from two Minnesota lakes, Lake Auburn and Cedar Lake, were
   sampled monthly during the summer of 1994. None of the black crappie
   (Pomoxis nigromaculatus) or yellow perch (Perca flavescens) stomachs
   from either lake contained E. lecontei. The frequency of occurrence of
   E. lecontei larvae and adults in sunfish (bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus)
   and pumpkinseed (Lepomis gibbosus)) stomachs from Lake Auburn ranged
   from 10.3% in September to 28.6% in August. The mean number of E.
   lecontei adults per sunfish stomach from Lake Auburn ranged from 0.18
   +/- 0.13 (+/- 2 S.E.) in May and July to 2.14 +/- 2.90 in August. Larvae
   of E. lecontei were found only in stomachs collected in August (mean =
   0.21 +/- 0.31) and September (mean = 0.33 +/- 0.41). Euhrychiopsis
   lecontei pupae were not found in fish stomachs from either lake.
   Euhrychiopsis lecontei was rarely represented in the diet of sunfish
   from Cedar Lake. Larvae and adults were found in sunfish. stomachs from
   Cedar Lake only during September (3.7% of stomachs; mean = 0.037 +/-
   0.052 per stomach). Densities of E, lecontei were much higher in Lake
   Auburn than Cedar Lake, however, within lakes there was no correlation
   between E, lecontei density and either mean number or percent occurrence
   in sunfish stomachs. These data suggest that sunfish predation may be
   important and that with low E, lecontei population densities and high
   sunfish densities, E. lecontei populations could be limited by sunfish
   predation.

AB The catechol estrogen metabolites of 17 beta-estradiol (E-2),
   2-hydroxyestradiol (OHE2) and 4-OHE2, differ in hormonal properties and
   carcinogenic potential. In Syrian hamster kidney, 4-OHE2 induces
   clear-cell carcinoma whereas 2-OHE2 does not, and an E-2 4-hydroxylase
   appears to be involved in E-2-induced carcinogenesis in these animals.
   Specific E-2 4-hydroxylase activity has been observed in extrahepatic
   tissues from several species. In humans, cytochrome P450 1B1 (CYP1B1)
   appears to be an extrahepatic E-2 4-hydroxylase under the regulatory
   control of the aromatic hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). As an initial
   approach to investigating CYP1B1 expression and E-2 4-hydroxylase
   activity in human kidney, we used the ACHN cell line, derived from a
   human renal adenocarcinoma. In untreated ACHN cells, a very low level of
   CYP1B1 mRNA expression was observed and CYP1B1 protein could not be
   detected; however, in ACHN cells exposed to the high-affinity AhR
   ligand, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), CYP1B1 mRNA levels
   were elevated 28-fold, and the CYP1B1 protein was detected by immunoblot
   analysis. Exposure of ACHN cells to TCDD resulted in minimal induction
   of the CYP1A1 mRNA, and the CYP1A1 protein was not detectable prior to
   or after exposure to TCDD. E-2 hydroxylase activity could not be
   detected with microsomes from untreated ACHN cells, although activities
   at C-4 and, to a lesser extent, at C-2 of E-2 were observed with
   microsomes from TCDD-treated ACHN cells. In experiments with intact ACHN
   cells, elevated rates of formation of 4-methoxyestradiol (MeOE2) and
   2-MeOE2 were observed in response to treatment with TCDD. The EC50 for
   induction of the CYP1B1 mRNA was 1.5 nM TCDD; EC(50)s for the
   stimulation of 2- and 4-MeOE2 formation were 0.68 and 1.1 nM TCDD. These
   results indicate that the ACHN cell line may be a useful in vitro model
   system to study the regulation of CYP1B1 expression and the cytotoxic
   effects associated with E-2 4-hydroxylation. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science

AB Human cytochrome P450 (P450) 1B1 (CYP1B1) has recently been shown to be
   an important enzyme in the activation of diverse procarcinogens such as
   arylarenes, nitroarenes, and arylamines to reactive metabolites that
   cause DNA damage in the cells. However, it is not known whether this
   P450 enzyme also plays roles in the oxidation of certain drugs or model
   substrates commonly used in P450 assays. We examined the substrate
   oxidation activities of recombinant human CYP1B1 in yeast microsomes and
   compared these activities with those catalyzed by reconstituted systems
   containing recombinant CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 which were isolated from
   membranes of Escherichia coli in which respective cDNAs have been
   expressed. Catalytic activities towards some of the model substrates of
   other human P450 enzymes including CYP2A6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4
   were also determined and compared. CYP1B1 catalyzed benzo[a]pyrene
   3-hydroxylation at rates lower than those of CYP1A1 but higher than
   those of CYP1A2. The activity towards 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylation
   catalyzed by CYP1B1 was about one-tenth of that of CYP1A1, but the K-m
   values were lower for CYP1B1 than those for CYP1A1 and CYP1A2. CYP1B1
   was also able to catalyze the oxidation of theophylline and caffeine,
   two prototypic substrates for CYP1A2. CYP1B1 did not oxidize other
   typical P450 substrates such as coumarin, tolbutamide, S-mephenytoin,
   chlorzoxazone, nifedipine, and testosterone, while low rates of
   oxidation of bufuralol and 7-ethoxycoumarin were found for CYP1B1. These
   results indicate that CYP1B1 has catalytic activities overlapping CYP1A1
   and CYP1A2 with respect to the oxidation of drugs and model P450
   substrates, although the relative catalytic roles in these three P450
   enzymes differ depending upon the substrates examined. A distinct marker
   activity of CYP1B1 has not been identified.

   cytochrome P4501B1 (CYP1B1) cDNA in an extrachromosomal vector which
   confers resistance to I-histidinol and co-expresses NADPH cytochrome
   P450 oxidoreductase (OR), The CYP1B1-expressing cell line was designated
   h1B1/OR, Microsomes prepared from CYP1B1 cDNA expressing cells exhibit
   elevated levels of 7-ethoxy-resorufin deethylase (EROD),
   7-ethoxy-4-trifluoromethyl-coumarin deethylase (EFCD), benzo(a)pyrene
   hydroxylase (BPH), bufuralol 1'-hydroxylase, testosterone hydroxylase
   activities and spectrally quantifiable cytochrome P450,
   CYP1B1-containing microsomes did not contain detectable coumarin
   7-hydroxylase, p-nitrophenol hydroxylase, lauric acid hydroxylase,
   (S)-mephenytoin 4'-hydroxylase or diclofenac 4'-hydroxylase activities,
   Kinetic parameters for selected substrates were compared among CYP1B1
   and the two additional members of the CYP1 family, CYP1A1 and CYP1A2,
   For BPH and EFCD, the rank order of rates of substrate metabolism were
   CYP1A1>CYP1B1>CYP1A2, For EROD, the rank order of substrate metabolism
   was CYP1A1>CYP1A2>CYP1B1. For both EROD and EFCD the apparent K-m values
   for CYP1B1 were more similar to CYP1A1 than to CYP1A2, In order to begin
   to characterize the promutagen activating ability of CYP1B1, the
   mutagenicity of selected chemicals was examined in h1B1/OR cells; there
   was increased sensitivity (CYP1B1-expressing relative to control cells)
   to the mutagenicity of benzo(a)pyrene, cyclopenta(c,d)pyrene,
   4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone and aflatoxin B-1 (AFB),
   CYP1B1, expressed in this system, appears to be particularly efficient

AB Cyclins D1 and E play critical roles in the progression of cells through
   the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Amplification and/or overexpression of
   the cyclin D1 gene and aberrant expression of cyclin E have been
   described in several forms of human cancer. In the present study, we
   examined the expression of these two genes by Western, Northern and
   Southern blot analyses in a series of primary human colon carcinomas of
   various stages and degrees of differentiation and in paired adjacent
   normal mucosa samples, and also in a series of human colon carcinoma
   cell lines. About 50% of the colon carcinomas displayed a two to five
   fold increase in the expression of cyclin D1 mRNA and protein, when
   compared with the paired normal mucosa samples. Six out of eight
   carcinomas examined showed a four to nine fold increase in cyclin E mRNA
   and about 50% of the carcinomas displayed a two to three fold increase
   in cyclin E protein. Low molecular weight cyclin E-related proteins were
   observed in four out of ten carcinomas. These changes in cyclins D1 and
   E occurred in both early and late stage tumors. Three of the six cell
   lines examined displayed a high expression of cyclin D1 mRNA and
   protein. A very high level of cyclin E mRNA expression was seen in
   HCT116 cells and this was associated with the presence of low molecular
   weight cyclin E-related proteins. None of the primary colon carcinomas
   nor the six cell lines examined displayed amplification of either the
   cyclin D1 or cyclin E genes. Thus, an aberrant expression of both
   cyclins D1 and E occurs in a significant fraction of human colon
   carcinomas.

AB Treatment of rats with the cancer chemopreventive agent
   1,2-dithiole-3-thione (D3T) resulted in a significant increase in
   hepatic heme oxygenase (HO) activity, which corresponded to increased
   protein levels of HO-1. Upon further analysis of proteins related to
   heme metabolism, the level of ferritin, the major iron storage protein
   in liver, was also found to be elevated, Diminished levels of
   intracellular free iron were monitored by EPR spectroscopy at times
   after administration of D3T that suggested that increased ferritin
   content sequesters intracellular iron, The increased levels of protein
   were associated with increased levels of steady-state RNA of HO-1 and
   the light (FL) and heavy (FH) subunits of ferritin. A direct
   relationship between enhanced rates of gene transcription and elevated
   levels of HO-1 and ferritin RNA was found. The inductions of FL and FH,
   but not HO-1, were sensitive to cycloheximide, suggesting that in vivo
   these genes are regulated by distinct D3T-responsive transcriptional
   mechanisms. The known protective roles for induced HO-1 and ferritin in
   cellular stress have been suggested to include increased levels of the
   antioxidant bilirubin and enhanced sequestration of intracellular iron
   into ferritin, which can effectively reduce iron-mediated reactive
   oxygen generation, Thus, protective actions of D3T against the cytotoxic
   and carcinogenic consequences of chemicals that exert electrophilic or
   oxidative stresses may be mediated, in part, by the induction of HO-1,
   FL and FH.

AB Dithiolethiones inhibit tumorigenicity elicited by many structurally
   diverse carcinogens in numerous target tissues. These protective actions
   are associated with the induction of several carcinogen detoxification
   enzymes, some of which have only recently been discovered. In order to
   identify additional novel inducible detoxification response genes, a
   cDNA library was prepared from liver of rats treated with
   1,2-dithiole-3-thione (D3T) and was screened by a differential
   hybridization method. Complementary DNA clones for several known
   D3T-inducible genes were isolated, such as epoxide hydrolase, aflatoxin
   B-1-aldehyde reductase, quinone reductase and multiple submits of
   glutathione S-transferase. Clones representing genes not previously
   associated with detoxification were isolated, including those for
   ferritin heavy and light subunits, ribosomal proteins L18a and S16 and
   two novel genes, termed dithiolethione-inducible genes (or DIG-1 and
   DIG-2). Levels of mRNA recognized by each clone were increased from 2-
   to 31-fold, with maximum induction between 6 and 30 h after treatment
   with D3T. Except for epoxide hydrolase, the kinetics of induction of
   each mRNA was coordinate with increased rates of gene transcription.
   However, based on the time of response to D3T, at least two sets of
   responsive genes were identified. One set of genes, including
   glutathione S-transferase Yp, aflatoxin B-1 aldehyde reductase, quinone
   reductase and DIG-1, had low constitutive and highly inducible
   expression (similar to 20-fold) and the other, including glutathione
   S-transferase Ya and Yb, epoxide hydrolase, ferritin heavy and light
   submits, ribosomal proteins L18a and S16 and DIG-2, had relatively high
   constitutive and modestly inducible expression (similar to 5-fold). The
   simplest explanation for this differential expression of D3T-inducible
   genes is that multiple regulatory mechanisms govern their response. The
   transcriptional activation of ferritin, ribosomal protein, DIG-1 and
   DIG-2 genes in conjunction with those of carcinogen detoxification
   enzymes suggests that they participate in the pleiotropic cellular
   defense response to dithiolethiones that inhibits chemically produced
   tumorigenesis.

AB The 4-hydroxy metabolite of 17 beta-estradiol (E(2)) has been implicated
   in the carcinogenicity of this hormone. Previous studies showed that
   aryl hydrocarbon-receptor agonists induced a cytochrome P450 that
   catalyzed the 4-hydroxylation of E(2). This activity was associated with
   human P450 1B1. To determine the relationship of the human P450 1B1 gene
   product and E(2) 4-hydroxylation, the protein was expressed in
   Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Microsomes from the transformed yeast
   catalyzed the 4- and 2-hydroxylation of E(2) with K-m values of 0.71 and
   0.78 mu M and turnover numbers of 1.39 and 0.27 nmol product min(-1).
   nmol P450(-1), respectively. Treatment of MCF-7 human breast cancer
   cells with the aryl hydrocarbon-receptor ligand indolo[3,2-b]carbazole
   resulted in a concentration-dependent increase in P450 1B1 and P450 1A1
   mRNA levels, and caused increased rates of 2-, 4-, 6 alpha-, and 15
   alpha-hydroxylation of E(2). At an E(2) concentration of 10 nM, the
   increased rates of 2- and 40-hydroxylation were approximately equal,
   emphasizing the significance of the low K-m P450 1B1-component of E(2)
   metabolism. These studies demonstrate that human P450 1B1 is a
   catalytically efficient E(2) 4-hydroxylase that is likely to participate
   in endocrine regulation and the toxicity of estrogens.

AB Background & Aims: Cyclin D1 gene amplification and/or overexpression
   occurs in several human cancers. The level of expression of cyclin D1
   protein during the multistage process of human colon carcinogenesis was
   determined. Methods: Cyclin D1 protein abundance was determined by
   immunostaining samples of normal colonic mucosa (n = 23), transitional
   normal mucosa adjacent to adenomas or adenocarcinomas (n = 41),
   hyperplastic polyps (n = 8), adenomatous polyps (n = 35), and
   adenocarcinomas (n = 27), using a polyclonal anti-human cyclin D1
   antibody. Results: Cyclin D1 nuclear staining occurred in 30% of
   adenocarcinomas and 34% of adenomatous polyps but not in hyperplastic
   polyps or normal or transitional mucosa. Nuclear staining did not
   correlate with sex, age, size, or dysplasia of the adenomatous polyps or
   with differentiation and Dukes' staging of the adenocarcinomas.
   Left-sided colon neoplasms showed nuclear staining more frequently than
   those right-sided lesions. Diffuse or supranuclear cytoplasmic staining
   occurred in about one third of hyperplastic polyps, adenomas, and
   adenocarcinomas and in transitional mucosa adjacent to adenocarcinoma.
   Conclusions: Increased nuclear expression of cyclin D1 occurs in around
   one third of colonic tumors as an early event during multistage process
   of colon carcinogenesis. increased expression of cyclin D1 may perturb
   cell-cycle control in benign adenomas and thereby enhance tumor
   progression.

AB 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) is a more potent
   hepatocarcinogen in female than in male or ovariectomized rats. A
   possible mechanism for this increased sensitivity is through enhanced
   metabolic activation of estrogens by TCDD-induced enzymes leading to
   oxidative damage in the cell. As a marker for oxidative DNA damage,
   8-oxo-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dC) was quantitated in livers of intact and
   ovariectomized Sprague-Dawley rats chronically treated with TCDD (125
   ng/kg per day) with and without diethylnitrosamine as initiator.
   Elevated levels of 8-oxo-dG were detected in a significantly greater
   number of the intact compared to ovariectomized TCDD-treated rats.
   Expression of CYP1B1 mRNA, a newly identified cytochrome P450 with
   proposed estrogen hydroxylase activity, was highly induced by TCDD, The
   results are consistent with the hypothesis that increased metabolism of
   endogenous estrogens to catechols by TCDD-induced enzymes may lead to
   increased oxidative DNA damage and hence contribute to TCDD-mediated
   hepatocarcinogenicity in female rats.

   adenocarcinomas are unknown, Activating mutations in the K-ras oncogene
   occur in about 40% of colonic adenocarcinomas, possibly reflecting the
   consequences of carcinogenic exposure, To study whether the low
   incidence of small bowel adenocarcinomas might be due to the absence of
   activation of cellular oncogenes in small bowel adenocarcinomas, we
   examined the frequency of K-ras mutations in small bowel
   adenocarcinomas. K-ras mutations were determined using a polymerase
   chain reaction (PCR)-based method to detect codon 12 mutations by
   restriction fragment length polymorphism, PCR amplification was
   successful in six of nine small bowel adenocarcinoma samples, and
   revealed point mutations of K-ras at codon 12 in five of these six
   cases, We conclude that the small bowel might be exposed to carcinogens
   similar to those responsible for colorectal cancer, but may have
   developed protective mechanisms against cancer formation.

AB Previously, we identified a novel human cytochrome P450 cDNA that is

   the first member of a new subfamily designated cytochrome P4501B1
   (CYP1B1; Sutter, T. R., Tang, Y. M., Hayes, C. L., Wo, Y. P., Jabs, E.
   W., Li, X., Yin, H., Cody, C. W., and Greenlee, W. F. (1994) J. Biol.
   Chem. 269, 13092-13099). Here, we report on the isolation and initial
   characterization of the CYP1B1 gene. The CYP1B1 gene maps to human
   chromosome 2 at 2p21-22 and contains three exons and two introns. The
   putative open reading frame starts in the second exon and is 1629 base
   pairs in length. Southern analysis using DNA probes directed to each of
   the three exons confirmed that CYP1B1 is a single copy gene. Human
   CYP1B1 differs from its two most closely related members of the
   cytochrome P450 superfamily, CYP1A1 and CYP1A2, in the number of exons
   (3 versus 7) and chromosome location (2 versus 15). A single
   transcription initiation site was identified by primer extension
   analysis and S1 nuclease mapping. Based on nucleotide sequence analysis,
   the CYP1B1 gene lacks a consensus TATA box in the promoter region and
   contains nine TCDD-responsive enhancer core binding motifs (5'-GCGTG-3')
   located within a 2.5-kilobase pair genomic fragment 5'-ward of the
   transcription initiation start site. Deletion analysis of
   chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene constructs containing 5'
   CYP1B1 genomic fragments indicates that a region from - 1022 to -835
   containing three of the nine core binding motifs contributes to the
   TCDD-inducible expression of CYP1B1.

   approach by applying it to the well-studied nongenotoxic carcinogen
   2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). Using a well-developed
   mechanistic understanding of the initial interactions of TCDD with the
   cell, we justify the selection of the minimal effective dose for CYP1A1
   mRNA induction as the BESTNOEL. With allowance for variation in human
   sensitivity to TCDD, the BESTNOEL is assigned a human liver tissue
   burden of approximately 0.25-25 ppt and an allowable daily intake level
   in the range of 15-1500 fg/kg/day. In the future, the BESTNOEL can help
   establish a lower boundary for acceptable extrapolation when using
   either statistical or biologically based attributable risk models. (C)

AB Oltipraz [5-(2-pyrazinyl)-4-methyl-1,2-dithiole-3-thione] protects
   against chemical carcinogenesis in several animal models and is
   currently under evaluation as a possible chemopreventive agent in
   humans. Ideally, clinical chemopreventive interventions use dosing
   regimens that maximize efficacy while minimizing toxicity. Toward this
   end, the chemopreventive efficacy achieved by administration of
   intermittent doses of oltipraz was evaluated in rats. F344 rats were
   treated with oltipraz (0.5 mmol/kg, p.o.) once weekly, twice weekly, or
   daily over a 5-week period. After the first week, all rats were gavaged
   with 20 mu g/kg of aflatoxin B-1 for 28 consecutive days. Livers were
   analyzed 2 months after the last aflatoxin B-1 dose, and the volume of
   liver occupied by glutathione S-transferase (GST)-P positive foci, a
   presumptive marker of neoplasia, was observed to be decreased >95%,
   >97%, or >99% in livers of rats receiving once-, twice-weekly or daily
   oltipraz treatments, respectively. The chemopreventive actions of
   oltipraz have been associated with increases in the levels of phase 2
   detoxifying enzymes, such as the glutathione S-transferase isozymes.
   Accordingly, GST conjugation activity measured with
   1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene as substrate increased 1.5-, 1.8-, or
   2.4-fold for the once-weekly, twice-weekly or daily treatments,
   respectively, throughout a 7-day period. Quantitative HPLC analyses of
   GST subunits 24 h after 2 or 7 daily administrations of oltipraz showed
   that the levels of subunits Yb-1, Yp, Yc(2), and Ya(2) were increased
   with maximum elevations of 5.6-, 11.1-, 6.4-, and 10.4-fold,
   respectively. In comparison, levels of subunits Yb-2 and Yc(1) were
   modestly elevated 1.8- to 2.6-fold, respectively, whereas subunit Ya,
   was not induced. Remarkably, the levels of subunit Yp and Ya, remained
   elevated approximate to 2.3-fold 7 days after a single dose of oltipraz.
   In contrast, the levels of subunits Yb-1 and Yc(2) diminished to
   approximate control levels within 7 days after a single dose of
   oltipraz. GST mRNA levels for Ya, Yb, and Yp were measured by Northern
   blot analysis and were found to be elevated maximally to 13.7-, 13.5-,
   and 3.9-fold, respectively, after two daily oltipraz doses.
   Interestingly, GST Ya and Yb mRNA diminished to constitutive levels
   after 7 daily doses of oltipraz, with no corresponding decreases in GST
   subunit or activity levels. The levels of GST Ya and Yb mRNA decreased
   to constitutive levels within 4 days after a single oltipraz
   administration, whereas GST Yp mRNA levels remained elevated throughout
   the 7-day follow-up period. These results suggest that the protracted
   pharmacodynamic actions of oltipraz on enzyme induction may account for
   the marked reduction in the hepatic burden of aflatoxin B-1-induced
   putative preneoplastic tumors after intermittent dosing. Consequently,
   scheduling of intermittent dosing protocols may sustain efficacy while
   improving drug tolerance and patient compliance over long-term
   treatments. These properties of oltipraz increase its attractiveness for
   clinical chemopreventive interventions.

AB The broad spectrum of biological responses associated with exposure to
   2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD, dioxin) is believed to be due
   to the alteration in expression of TCDD-inducible genes. The aim of this
   study was to investigate the effects of TCDD on the in vivo
   tissue-specific expression of the recently identified TCDD-inducible
   cytochrome P450 CYP1B1 [Sutter et al, (1994) J. Biol. Chem., 269,
   13092-13099] in Sprague-Dawley rats. We cloned the 5.0 kb rat homolog of
   CYP1B1 from a TCDD-treated rat liver cDNA library and showed that the
   rat and human CYP1B1 predicted amino acid sequences are 80% identical.
   RNA hybridization analysis showed that CYP1B1 is constitutively
   expressed in the adrenal glands and also in the testes of untreated
   rats. This tissue distribution suggests that CYP1B1 may be a
   physiological steroid hydroxylase. Seventy-two hours post-administration
   of 25 mu g/kg body wt TCDD by gavage, steady-state levels of the 5.1 kb
   CYP1B1 RNA were increased > 50-fold in liver, and to a lesser extent in
   kidneys, lung, heart and ovaries. Average CYP1B1 RNA levels were
   significantly higher in the kidneys and livers of TCDD-treated females
   than in those from similarly treated males. In contrast, no significant
   sex-difference was observed in the levels of CYP1A1 in these tissues in
   TCDD-treated animals. In Sprague-Dawley rats, TCDD is a more potent
   hepatocarcinogen in females than in males. The induction of CYP1B1 in
   TCDD rat liver may be a contributing factor to the carcinogenic action
   of this persistent environmental pollutant.

AB Rates of microsomal 17 beta-estradiol (E(2)) hydroxylation at the C-2,
   -4, -6 alpha, and -15 alpha positions are each induced greater than
   10-fold by treating MCF-7 breast cancer cells with
   2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). The TCDD-induced activities
   at the C-2, -6 alpha and -15 alpha positions have been attributed to
   cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1); however, the low K-m 4-hydroxylase induced
   by TCDD appears to be a distinct enzyme. We report here that antibodies
   to cytochrome P450-EF (mouse CYP1B1) selectivity inhibited the C-4
   hydroxylation of E, catalyzed by microsomes from TCDD-treated MCF-7
   cells. Western blots probed with anti-CYP1B antibodies showed the
   induction of a 52 kDa microsomal protein in response to treatment with
   TCDD in MCF-7 cells. Western blots of microsomes from HepG2 cells did
   not show the TCDD-induced 52 kDa protein, and microsomes from
   TCDD-treated HepG2 cells did not catalyze a low K-m hydroxylation of
   E(2) at C-4. Cellular metabolism experiments also showed induction of
   both the C-2 and -4 hydroxylation pathways in TCDD-treated MCF-7 cells
   as evidenced by elevated 2- and 4-methoxyestradiol (MeOE(2)) formation.
   In contrast, TCDD-treated HepG2 cells showed 2-MeOE(2) formation
   predominantly over 4-MeOE(2). Northern blots of RNA isolated from
   untreated and TCDD-treated cells, when probed with the human CYP1B1
   cDNA, showed induction of a 5.2 kb RNA in MCF-7 cells but not in HepG2
   cells in response to treatment with TCDD. These results provide
   additional evidence for the induction by TCDD of a novel E(2)
   4-hydroxylase in MCF-7 cells but not in HepG2 cells and indicate
   possible endocrine regulatory roles for the newly discovered group of
   enzymes of the CYP1B subfamily.

AB Previously, levels of a novel human mRNA detected by a recombinant cDNA
   designated clone 1, were shown to be increased 50-fold in response to
   treatment of a keratinocyte cell line with
   2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), in part as a function of
   increased rates of gene transcription (Sutter, T. R., Guzman, K., Dold,
   K. M., and Greenlee, W. F. (1991) Science 254, 415-418). Here we report
   the complete corresponding 5.1-kilobase cDNA sequence. A single open
   reading frame that predicts a protein of 543 amino acid residues was
   determined by computer-assisted analysis of the cDNA sequence. This
   predicted protein identifies a new gene subfamily of cytochrome P450,
   cytochrome P4501B1 (CYP1B1), that maps to human chromosome 2. Southern
   blot analysis of genomic DNA indicates that the human CYP1B subfamily is
   likely to contain only this single gene. Northern blot analysis of RNA
   isolated from primary cultures of normal human epidermal keratinocytes
   showed similar to 100-fold increased levels of the CYP1B1 mRNA after
   treatment with 10 nM TCDD for 24 h. Low levels of constitutive CYP1B1
   mRNA were detected in 15 different human tissue samples. These results
   indicate that CYP1B1 is expressed in many normal human tissues and
   advance our understanding of the complexity of a gene family of
   cytochromes P450 whose expression is altered by TCDD.

AB Human keratinocytes are an important source of cytokines that
   participate in inflammatory and immunological processes of the skin.
   2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) has been shown to enhance the
   expression of the cytokine, interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), in a human
   keratinocyte cell line. Here we have expanded this observation to
   primary cultures of normal human epidermal keratinocytes. Treatment of
   these cells with TCDD resulted in increased expression of IL-1 beta
   mRNA. Both the magnitude and relative fold increase of levels of IL-1
   beta mRNA were affected by specific culture conditions. In specific
   analyses of each culture medium supplement, bovine pituitary extract
   (BPE) was shown to exert the greatest effect on bath the constitutive
   and TCDD-inducible expression of IL-1 beta mRNA, and this effect of BPE
   was shown to be concentration-dependent. These results indicate that, in
   vitro, enhanced expression of IL-1 beta is a response of normal human
   epidermal keratinocytes to TCDD and furthermore, that the intensity of
   this response may be modulated by additional growth factors, including
   those present in BPE.
