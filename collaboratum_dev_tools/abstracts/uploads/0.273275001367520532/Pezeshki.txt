AB Cuttings of black willow (Salix nigra), a naturally occurring wetland
   species, are used for restoration and streambank stabilization. As an
   adaptation to their wetland habitat, this species develops aerenchyma
   tissue to avoid root anoxia. To determine the effects of combined copper
   and ultraviolet-B radiation exposure on aerenchyma tissue (measured as
   root porosity), black willow cuttings were grown hydroponically and
   exposed to three ultraviolet-B (UV-B) intensities and three Cu
   concentrations in a completely randomized 3x3 factorial design. While
   both UV-B (F(2,42)=11.45; p=0.0001) and Cu (F(2,42)=6.14; p=0.0046)
   exposure increased root porosity, total biomass decreased in response to
   both UV-B (F(2,43)=3.36; p=0.0441) and to Cu (F(2,43)=4.03; p=0.0249).
   Root biomass decreased only in response to Cu (F(2,41)=3.41; p=0.0427)
   resulting in a decrease in the root/shoot ratio (F(2,42)=3.5; p=0.0393).
   Copper exposure also resulted in a decrease in the number of
   leaves/shoot (F(2,42)=7.03; P=0.0023). No UV-B and Cu interaction was
   found. While the present research indicates the negative effects of Cu
   contamination and elevated UV-B intensities on S. nigra, it also points
   out potential mechanisms that S. nigra uses to alleviate these stresses.

AB Data on vegetation composition and structure, soil and leaf nutrient
   pools, soil redox potential, and surface water hydrologic connectivity
   were collected from floodplains along six river reaches in western
   Tennessee to examine the effects of channel modifications on associated
   riparian systems. Comparisons among channelization treatments
   (non-channelized reaches, channelized and leveed reaches, channelized
   but non-leveed reaches) and floodplain geomorphology (depression and
   nondepressional sites) showed that hydrologic connectivity was affected
   by channelization treatments, particularly leveeing. The disconnected
   floodplains were drier, maintained higher nutrient pools, and had
   greater herbaceous biomass than floodplains still connected to channel
   hydrology. Runoff onto floodplains from the agriculturally dominated
   landscape of channelized and leveed tributaries, and flooding stress in
   the form of scour on floodplains along streams without levees may
   explain the observed pattern. Channel and floodplain hydrologic
   processes were most strongly connected for unchannelized streams.
   Unchannelized streams were varied in soil redox potential, water table,
   and nutrient pools. Vegetation composition reflects both historical
   hydrologic regimes and disturbances, and thus complex relationships to
   channel modifications. Results suggest both the subsidy (i.e., nutrient
   inputs) and the stress of flood events have been altered by
   anthropogenic activities, but these alterations were greatest in
   channelized systems compared to unchannelized systems.

AB The restoration of potentially species-rich stream ecosystems in
   physically unstable environments is challenging, and few attempts have
   been evaluated scientifically. Restoration approaches that involve
   living and dead native vegetation are attractive economically and from
   an ecological standpoint. A 2-km reach of an incised, sand-bed stream in
   northern Mississippi was treated with large wood structures and willow
   plantings to trigger responses that would result in increasing
   similarity with a lightly degraded reference stream. Experimental
   approaches for stream bank and gully stabilization were also examined.
   Although the project was initially successful in producing improved
   aquatic habitat, after 4 yr it had failed to effectively address issues
   related to flashy watershed hydrology and physical instability manifest
   by erosion and sedimentation. The success of ecosystem rehabilitation
   was thus governed by landscape-scale hydrological and geomorphological
   processes.

AB A study quantifying the physiological threshold at which Spartina
   alterniflora plants are able to tolerate the interactive effects of
   salinity and soil drying was conducted in a climate controlled
   greenhouse. The experiment consisted of two levels of salinity (3-5 ppt,
   L and 35-38 ppt, H) as well as four dynamic water levels: flooding
   (water level maintained 3-5 cm above the soil surface at high tide and
   10 cm below the soil surface at tow tide for entire study duration, F),
   8-day drought (water level maintained at least 20 cm below the soil
   surface at high tide for 8 days then flooded, 8 days), 16-day drought
   (water level, maintained at least 20cm below the soil surface at high
   tide for 16 days then flooded, 16 days), and 24-day drought (water
   level, maintained at least 20cm below the soil surface at high tide for
   24 days then flooded, 24 days). Plant gas exchange and growth responses
   were measured along with soil conditions of redox potential and water
   potential. Significant decreases were seen in plant gas exchange and
   growth in response to increases in salinity and soil drying. Survival
   was 100% for all flooded treatments white increased salinity combined
   with soil drying decreased survival to 86% in both low salt/24-day
   drought plants (LD24) and high salt/16-day drought plants (HD16). The
   lowest survival rate was seen in the high salt/24-day drought treatment
   (HD24) at 29%. Therefore, it appears that the critical time for recovery
   from the combined effects of increased salinity and soil drying may
   greatly diminish after two weeks from the onset of stress conditions.
   Consequently, if salinity continues to increase along the MRDP, marshes
   dominated by S. alterniflora may be more susceptible to short-term
   drought and likewise large-scale marsh browning. (c) 2006 Elsevier GmbH.

AB A field study was conducted at Little Topashaw Creek in northern
   Mississippi, aimed at expanding the limited database on the survivorship
   of Salix nigra (black willow) cuttings planted on riparian restoration
   sites. We tested the hypothesis that sediment moisture availability
   (deficit, excess) as mediated by sediment texture and depth to the
   prevailing water table is a major factor governing black willow survival
   during the initial stage of establishment following transplanting.
   Replicated plots were established across elevational gradients and a
   range of soil texture. Each plot contained 16 planted cuttings (2.5 cm
   diameter x 2.5 m length). Plot depth to water table, soil texture, and
   soil redox potential were measured. Plant gas exchange, leaf chlorophyll
   content, growth, and survival were monitored periodically over two
   growing seasons. Survival was best at low elevation compared to cuttings
   planted at mid- and high elevations. Poor survival and growth were noted
   for cuttings that encountered sediment moisture deficits in plots with
   coarse texture while the best cutting survival was recorded for
   intermediate sand content plots. Results indicated that plot location on
   the bank and soil texture are two important factors that influence
   riverbank restoration success. Therefore, any riparian restoration plan
   should include careful assessment of these factors prior to undertaking
   such efforts. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

AB Black willow (Salix nigra) cuttings are used for streambank
   stabilization where they are subjected to a range of soil moisture
   conditions including flooding. Flooding has been shown to adversely
   impact cutting performance, and improved understanding of natural
   adaptations to flooding might suggest handling and planting techniques
   to enhance success. However, data assessing the root aeration in
   adventitious roots that are developed on cuttings of woody species are
   scant. In addition, it appears that no data are available regarding
   aeration of the root system under partially flooded conditions. This
   experiment was designed to examine the effects of continuous flooding
   (CF) and partial flooding (PF) on aerenchyma formation and radial oxygen
   loss (ROL) in black willow cuttings. Photosynthetic and growth responses
   to these conditions were also investigated. Under laboratory condition,
   replicated potted cuttings were subjected to three treatments: no
   flooding (control, C), CF, and PF Water was maintained above the soil
   surface in CF and at 10cm depth in PF Results indicated that after the
   28-d treatments, root porosity ranged between 28.6% and 33.0% for the CF
   and C plants but was greater for the PF plants (39.2% for the drained
   and 37.2% for the flooded portions). A similar response pattern was
   found for ROL. In addition, CF treatment led to decreases in final root
   biomass and root/shoot ratio. Neither CF nor PF had any detectable
   adverse effects on plant gas exchange or photosystem II functioning. Our
   results indicated that S. nigra cuttings exhibited avoidance mechanisms
   in response to flooding, especially the partially flooded condition
   which is the most common occurrence in riparian systems. (c) 2005

AB Herbivory and flooding influence plant species composition and diversity
   in many wetland ecosystems. Black willow (Salix nigra) naturally occurs
   in floodplains and riparian zones of the southeastern United States.
   Cuttings from this species are used as a bioengineering tool for
   streambank stabilization and habitat rehabilitation. The present study
   was conducted to evaluate the photosynthetic and growth responses of
   black willow to simulated herbivory and flooding. Potted cuttings were
   subjected to three levels of single-event herbivory: no herbivory
   (control), light herbivory, and heavy herbivory; and three levels of
   flooding conditions: no flooding (control), continuous flooding, and
   periodic flooding. Results indicated that elevated stomata] conductance
   partially contributed to the increased net photosynthesis noted under
   both levels of herbivory on day 30. However, chlorophyll content was not
   responsible for the observed compensatory photosynthesis. Cuttings
   subjected to heavy herbivory accumulated the lowest biomass even though
   they had the highest height growth by the conclusion of the experiment.
   In addition, a reduction in root/shoot ratio was noted for plants
   subjected to continuous flooding with no herbivory. However,
   continuously flooded, lightly clipped plants allocated more resources to
   roots than shoots. This study provides evidence that it is feasible to
   use black willow for habitat rehabilitation along highly eroded
   streambanks where both flooding and herbivory are present. (c) 2005

   uptake and biomass production of wiregrass (Spartina patens). Biomass
   production doubled in response to the addition of 10g N m(-2). A
   salinity-nutrient interaction was shown. Plants grown in fertilized
   treatments at 0 ppt had significantly greater biomass production than
   plants grown under fertilized treatment and 8 ppt salinity. However, a
   significantly greater amount of biomass was measured in both fertilized
   treatments (0 and 8 ppt) as compared to control. Lowering of salinity
   alone also stimulated plant growth. Results demonstrated that proposed

   of Breton Sound should enhance plant growth and improve marsh stability.

AB A greater than 98% decline in Arundinaria gigantea (Walt.) Muhl. (giant
   cane or river cane) canebrake communities have resulted in a critically
   endangered ecosystem. Historical accounts suggest loss of canebrake
   habitat has resulted in the extirpation (and perhaps extinction) of many
   species. Thus, canebrake restoration is necessary for maintaining and
   enhancing biodiversity in the southeastern United States. The purpose of
   this study is to facilitate reestablishing A. gigantea canebrakes by
   optimizing growth and survivorship conditions for seedlings. To this
   end, we developed a lab experiment to test the effects of soil moisture
   (periodic drought, periodic flooding, and well-drained) and nitrogen
   fertilization on A. gigantea seedling growth and physiology. Arundinaria
   gigantea, while able to survive both drought and flooding, had
   significantly greater growth under well-drained conditions. Shoot growth
   averaged 28 cm and root growth averaged 11 cm in well-drained pots.
   Seedlings grown in flooded and drought treatments were not significantly
   different, averaging 20 cm in shoot growth and 4 cm in root growth.
   Biomass results mirrored shoot and root growth; biomass of roots and
   shoots was 30% greater under well-drained conditions. Nitrogen
   fertilization did not significantly affect seedling growth or
   physiology. Neither stomatal conductance nor net photosynthesis was
   significantly affected by moisture regime or nitrogen fertilization.
   However, results imply soil moisture regime as a significant factor
   controlling the growth and distribution of A. gigantea, and thus
   canebrake restoration will likely be most successful on well-drained
   soils.

AB Current streambank restoration efforts focus on providing bank
   stability, enhancing water quality, and improving woody habitat using
   native vegetation rather than traditional engineering techniques.
   However, in most cases harsh site conditions limit restoration success.
   A two-year field study was conducted at Twentymile Creek, in northern
   Mississippi, investigating edaphic factors governing the survival of
   black willow (Salix nigra) cuttings used for streambank restoration. Low
   height growth, above-ground biomass production, and average leaf area
   were observed in willow cuttings grown in plots subjected to moisture
   deficits. However, sediment texture emerged as the dominant factor
   determining willow post growth, health, and survival, Shoot biomass,
   leaf biomass, and total above-ground biomass were 15-, 10-, and 14-fold
   greater for large willow cuttings (posts) grown in plots with sandy
   sediments relative to those grown in plots with similar moisture and
   soil redox potential but with silt and clay sediments. Average leaf
   size, average leaf mass and specific leaf area were all lower in fine
   textured plots. Under moisture conditions present at our sites,
   coarse-grained sediment (sand) was more conducive to willow growth,
   biomass production, and survival than were fine-grained sediments
   (silt/clay). Our results strongly suggest that soil texture and moisture
   conditions can determine restoration success. Therefore, it is critical
   that site conditions are factored into the selection of project
   locations prior to the initiation of willow planting restoration
   projects.

AB Black willow (Salix nigra ) uses periodic flood events for dispersal of
   vegetative propagules, subjecting them to periods of soaking before
   their deposition along the streambank. It was hypothesized that this
   life history trait results in optimal conditions for willow growth and
   survival. To test this hypothesis, a greenhouse experiment was conducted
   using 1.2-m-long black willow cuttings (posts) with a basal diameter of
   5 cm. Cuttings were subjected to three soaking treatments (0, 3, and 10
   days) and then grown under four soil moisture regimes (control, drought,
   permanently flooded, and intermittently flooded). Growth, biomass, and
   survival were recorded. Results showed that soaking posts for 10 days
   was most beneficial in the control soil moisture regime, enhancing root,
   shoot, leaf, and total biomass production. Shoot abundance and growth
   were also enhanced by 10 days of soaking in the control and permanently
   flooded moisture regimes. Finally, survival increased significantly in
   control and drought moisture regimes in response to the 10-day soaking
   treatment. Results clearly demonstrated that soaking had significant
   effects on willow post success when evaluated across all soil moisture
   regimes. Posts subjected to the 10-day soaking treatment consistently
   had greatest growth and biomass and displayed a doubling of the survival
   rate. Therefore, soaking willow cuttings before planting is a simple,
   inexpensive technique that may be used to bolster streambank restoration
   success.

   conditions. Following completion of Phase I, seedlings in each treatment

   divided into four groups: Control (A), intermittent flooding during
   Phase I and draining during Phase II (B), control during Phase I and
   continuously flooding during Phase II (C), and intermittently flooded
   during Phase I and continuously flooded during Phase II (D). Stomatal

   not significantly affected by flooding while in oaks, Pn and gw
   decreased significantly in response to flooding. In oaks, flood
   pre-conditioning did not affect growth or physiological responses during
   phase ii significantly. However, stomatal conductance of flood-hardened
   baldcypress was increased compared to seedlings that were not hardened.
   The study species developed significantly higher root porosity under

   appear to increase root porosity although it may have accelerated the

AB Ligustrum sinense (Chinese privet) is an introduced species in the
   United States. Dense stands of L. sinense are found in the understory in
   many bottomland forests in western Tennessee. The widespread abundance
   of this species is problematic because of the potential loss of valuable
   native bottomland species due to competition. Flooding has been proposed
   as a potential means of eradicating this species. Therefore, the
   objectives of this experiment were to examine survival, growth, and
   physiological responses of L. sinense under various flooding and shading
   regimes. An experiment consisting of three levels of flooding (control,
   shallow flooding, and deep flooding) and three levels of shading (full
   sun, 30-35% full sun (photosynthetic active radiation), and 10-15% sun)
   was performed in a greenhouse. Plant gas exchange was adversely affected
   in all flooded plants. Likewise, growth (height and diameter) was lower
   in those plants that were flooded as compared to non-flooded plants.
   However, morphological adaptations (i.e., lenticels and adventitious
   roots) were observed by the third week of the experiment. Plant survival
   in flooded treatments was 75% by the conclusion of the experiment, with
   an equal rate of survival seen in the shaded treatments compared to
   non-shaded. Although flooding alone did have significant effects on
   physiological function and growth, shading and shading x flooding
   interaction were not significant. Our data support the hypothesis that
   L. sinense is capable of withstanding both short-term flooding and
   shading; thus, shea-term flooding is unlikely to irradicate this species
   from the infested bottomland stands.

   regimes, from continuous flooding to mild drought, were imposed
   separately. A well-watered, well-drained treatment served as the
   control. Leaf gas exchange (stomatal conductance and net
   photosynthesis), survival, and biomass production of posts were
   evaluated. The stomatal conductance and net photosynthesis data clearly
   demonstrated the sensitivity:of willow posts to low oxygen conditions
   (under flooded treatments) as well as to soil drought. Growth and
   biomass were also adversely affected by flooding and drought treatments.
   The patterns of roof development along the posts seemed to be associated
   with the watering regime. Root biomass was depressed in zones subjected
   to flooding and low soil redox potential. In addition, leaf area, leaf
   biomass, and shoot (leaf + branch) biomass were significantly lower in
   the continuously-hooded and drought treatments as compared to control
   plants. Results indicated that maximum photosynthesis and growth in
   willow posts required ample soil-moisture (but-non-waterlogging
   conditions) and adequate drainage in the top 60 cm of soil. The use of
   willow posts for streambank restoration remains as a viable strategy;
   however, considerations should be given to water-table elevations, soil
   Eh conditions, soil moisture regime, and soil texture in order to
   improve the prospect for successful results.

   freshwater sites in Louisiana. Seedlings from all families tolerated
   flooding with water of low (2 g l(-1)) salinity. Differences in biomass
   among families became most apparent at the highest: salinity levels (6
   and 8 g l(-1)), Overall, increasing salinity reduced leaf biomass more
   than root biomass, which in turn was reduced more than stem biomass. A
   subset of seedlings from the main greenhouse experiment was periodically
   placed indoors under artificial light, and measurements were made of gas
   exchange and leaf water potential, Also, tissue concentrations of Cl-,
   Na+, K+, and Ca2+ were determined at the end of the greenhouse
   experiment. Significant intraspecific variation was found for nearly all
   the physiological parameters evaluated, but only leaf concentrations of
   Na+ and Cl- were correlated with an index of family-level differences in
   salt tolerance.

AB Under controlled laboratory conditions, cattail (Typha domingensis
   Pers.) and sawgrass (Cladium jamaicense Crantz) were subjected to a
   range of soil redox potential (Eh) including +500, +250, 0 and -200 mV
   and plant photosynthetic activity and growth responses were measured. In
   both species, light saturation was not achieved at the highest photon
   irradiance of 1100 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). Sawgrass showed greater
   photosynthetic capacity per unit area of leaf at higher irradiances than
   cattail. However, light compensation points were estimated at 25 and 60
   mu mol m(-2) s(-1) for cattail and sawgrass, respectively, In both
   species, stomatal conductance was reduced significantly in response to
   the lowest Eh condition (-200 mV). Net photosynthesis decreased
   significantly in both species in response to the reduced Eh conditions,
   but there were differences, The reductions were proportionally greater
   in sawgrass than in cattail. Thus, at -200 mV Eh, net photosynthesis was
   reduced by 71% for cattail; while in sawgrass there was no net
   photosynthesis, only respiration. Cattail showed significantly greater
   net photosynthetic rates as compared with sawgrass at the lowest Eh
   treatment (-200 mV). Although total biomass was reduced in both species
   in response to low Eh conditions, it nevertheless was significantly
   greater in cattail than sawgrass under 0 and -200 mV soil Eh treatments.
   However, the biomass allocation pattern did not differ between the two
   species across treatments. Results of the present study support the
   hypothesis that in both species differences in pattern of site occupancy
   and competition under low soil oxygen conditions may be partially
   explained by differences in their photosynthetic characteristics and
   photosynthetic acclimation to oxygen-deficient environments.

AB Coastal wetlands of the southeastern United States are threatened by
   increases in flooding and salinity as a result of both natural processes
   and man-induced hydrologic alterations. Furthermore, global climate
   change scenarios suggest that, as a consequence of rising sea levels,
   much larger areas of coastal wetlands may be affected by flooding and
   salinity in the next 50 to 100 years. In this paper, we review studies
   designed to improve our ability to predict and ameliorate the impacts of
   increased flooding and salinity stress on baldcypress (Taxodium
   distichum (L.) Rich.), which is a dominant species of many coastal
   forested wetlands. Specifically, we review studies on species-level
   responses to flooding and salinity stress, alone and in combination, we
   summarize two studies on intraspecific variation in response to flooding
   and salinity stress, we analyze the physiological mechanisms thought to
   be responsible for the interaction between flooding and salinity stress,
   and we discuss the implications for coastal wetland loss and the
   prospects for developing salt-tolerant lines of baldcypress.
