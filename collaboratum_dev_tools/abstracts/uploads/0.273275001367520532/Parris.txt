AB Amphibians around the world are experiencing the greatest organismal
   decline in recent history. Xenobiotics, such as pesticides, and
   pathogenic biotic perturbations, including the fungus Batrachochytrium
   dendrobatidis (Bd), have played major roles in amphibian decreases. We
   conducted laboratory culture studies to determine the effects of three
   pesticides {carbaryl, glyphosate, and thiophanate-methyl [TM;
   Topsin-M(R) (Cerexagri-Nisso LLC)]} on Bd zoospore production and
   zoosporangia growth. We applied Bd to pesticides mixed in an agar
   culture to simulate pathogen introduction to a system with pre-existing
   pesticides (Bd addition). Alternatively, pesticides were applied to
   pre-established Bd to simulate pesticide introduction after Bd
   establishment (pesticide addition). We then measured Bd zoosporangia and
   zoospore production. All pesticides significantly inhibited zoospore
   production; however, glyphosate and TM were more effective at doing so
   than carbaryl. In addition, only carbaryl and glyphosate inhibited
   zoosporangia production. Our data suggest that carbaryl and glyphosate
   are equally effective at inhibiting both zoosporangia and zoospore
   production; however, TM is selectively toxic to zoospores but not
   zoosporangia. One possible explanation for this observation could be
   that TM is toxic to zoospores but not the protective zoosporangia. In
   the case of pesticides applied to established Bd cultures, all
   pesticides caused significant mortality in both zoosporangia and
   zoospores, and no differences were found among pesticides. We conclude
   that examining pesticide and pathogen interactions independent of hosts
   provides mechanistic understanding of such interactions before and after
   host infection or contamination.

AB The immune system is a necessary, but potentially costly, defense
   against infectious diseases. When nutrition is limited, immune activity
   may consume a significant amount of an organism's energy budget. Levels
   of dietary protein affect immune system function; high levels can
   enhance disease resistance. We exposed southern leopard frog [Lithobates
   sphenocephalus (=Rana sphenocephala)] tadpoles to high and low protein
   diets crossed with the presence or absence of the pathogenic amphibian
   chytrid fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis; Bd) and quantified: (1)
   tadpole resistance to Bd; (2) tadpole skin-swelling in response to
   phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) injection (a measure of the T cell-mediated
   response of the immune system); (3) bacterial killing ability (BKA) of
   tadpole blood (a measure of the complement-mediated cytotoxicity of the
   innate immune system); and (4) tadpole growth and development. Tadpoles
   raised on a low-protein diet were smaller and less developed than
   tadpoles on a high-protein diet. When controlled for developmental
   stage, tadpoles raised on a low-protein diet had reduced PHA and BKA
   responses relative to tadpoles on a high-protein diet, but these immune
   responses were independent of Bd exposure. High dietary protein
   significantly increased resistance to Bd. Our results support the
   general hypothesis that host condition can strongly affect disease
   resistance; in particular, fluctuations in dietary protein availability
   may change how diseases affect populations in the field.

AB Life-cycle polyphenism has been hypothesized to facilitate ecological
   speciation in salamanders. A recent study demonstrated that the Eastern
   Newt (Notophthalmus viridescens) subspecies genetically differ in
   expression of life-cycle polyphenism. However, we currently lack direct
   evidence that the life-history divergence among the newt subspecies is
   associated with the suggested ecological parameters, namely availability
   of wetlands and suitable terrestrial habitats. To test such
   associations, we examined life-history traits of two subspecies,
   Notophthalmus viridescens viridescens and Notophthalmus viridescens
   dorsalis, across the subspecies boundary, which corresponds with changes
   in those ecological parameters between the Piedmont Plateau and the
   Coastal Plain. We reared larval newts derived from the two focal
   subspecies across the contact zone in outdoor mesocosms under two
   different hydroperiod treatments (three-month drying and permanent
   water). We found striking genetically based differences in life-history
   traits. The vast majority of larval N. v. viridescens metamorphosed to
   terrestrial juveniles (efts) regardless of pond hydroperiod treatments.
   In contrast, only a small portion of larval N. v. dorsalis (<30%)
   metamorphosed to efts under either hydroperiod treatment, whereas more
   than 70% of its larvae became aquatic metamorphic or paedomorphic adults
   under permanent water conditions. Notophthalmus viridescens viridescens
   also metamorphosed to efts at a smaller body size and over a shorter
   larval period than N. v. dorsalis. The pattern of the life-history
   change was closely related to the environmental change across the
   subspecies boundary. The present study provides direct evidence of
   divergent selection associated with the ecological parameters driving
   the life-history divergence among the newt subspecies.

AB Several studies have explored various components of feeding kinematics
   in anuran larvae; however, a direct comparison of feeding kinematics
   among morphologically similar and sympatric taxa has not been
   undertaken. We used high-speed videography (500 frames/s) to capture
   feeding kinematics of Anaxyrus fowleri (Hinckley, 1882) (Fowler's Toad),
   Hyla chrysoscelis (Cope, 1880) (Grey Treefrog), Scaphiopus holbrookii
   (Harlan, 1835) (Eastern Spadefoot Toad), and Lithobates sphenocephalus
   (Cope, 1889) (Southern Leopard Frog) tadpoles as they foraged from an
   algal-covered substrate. In total, we filmed 120 feeding sequences from
   25 feeding bouts and quantified eight kinematic variables that were
   common among all four species. Despite relatively similar keratinized
   feeding structures among taxa, our videography data revealed fundamental
   differences in how the tadpoles used these structures. One specific
   difference was in the speed of the gape cycle. Among taxa, S. holbrookii
   tadpoles had the longest gape cycle and longest time to reach maximum
   gape, whereas A. fowleri and L. sphenocephalus tadpoles had shorter
   durations for both variables and did not differ between species. We also
   found species differences in the magnitude that tadpoles narrow their
   lower jaw sheath. Irrespective of gape size, the lower jaw sheath of S.
   holbrookii tadpoles narrowed by approximately 26% of its maximum width-a
   twofold difference from A. fowleri tadpoles, which narrowed only 13%.
   Our study revealed that tadpoles with similar oral structures feeding on
   the same substrate can exhibit major differences in feeding kinematics.

AB Speciation processes initiated by divergent selection often fail to
   complete; yet, how sexual selection is involved in the progress of
   ecological speciation is rarely understood. Intraspecific body-size
   variation affects mate preference and male-male competition, which can
   consequently lead to assortative mating based on body size. In the
   present study, we tested the importance of body size difference in the
   potential of assortative mating between the two eastern newt subspecies,
   larger Notophthalmus viridescens viridescens and smaller Notophthalmus
   viridescens dorsalis. Through differential expression of life-cycle
   polyphenism, these two subspecies are adapted to contrasting
   environments, which has likely led to the subspecific body-size
   difference. We found that males of both subspecies preferred larger
   females of N. v. viridescens as mates presumably because of the
   fecundity advantage of larger females. On the other hand, no evidence of
   female choice was found. Larger males of N. v. viridescens exhibited
   greater competitive ability and gained primary access to larger females
   of their own kind. However, smaller males were able to overcome their
   inferior competitive ability by interfering with larger males'
   spermatophore transfer and sneakily mating with larger females. Thus,
   the subspecific body-size difference importantly affected sexual
   selection processes, resulting in nonrandom but not completely
   assortative mating patterns between the larger and smaller subspecies.
   Although life-cycle polyphenism facilitates the intraspecific ecological
   divergence within N. v. viridescens sexual selection processes, namely
   smaller males' mate preference for larger females and sexual
   interference during spermatophore transfer, may be halting completion of
   the ecological speciation. (C) 2010 The Linnean Society of London,

AB The keratinized mouthparts of tadpoles are complex structures that play
   a significant role in feeding. Recent evidence has shown that the
   keratinized labial teeth function in two ways: to anchor the oral disc
   to a substrate and to rake material from it. Reports of tadpoles with
   missing or deformed keratinized oral structures have increased. Yet, the
   impact missing teeth has on feeding remains unexplored. Here we use high
   speed videography (500 frames per second) of tadpoles of Southern
   Leopard Frog (Lithobates sphenocephalus [=Rana sphenocephala]) to study
   how missing teeth affect feeding. Specifically, we test the hypothesis
   that the number of teeth present correlates with two metrics of the
   effectiveness of a tadpole to rake material from a substrate. Those are
   the duration of the full gape cycle (opening and closing of the jaws)
   and of the closing phase (closing of the jaws once attached to a
   substrate). We found a significant positive relationship between
   duration of time of the closing phase of the gape cycle and the number
   of labial teeth present. Thus, tadpoles with fewer teeth were in contact
   with a planar algal-covered substrate for a shorter duration than
   tadpoles with more teeth. Given the reports of tadpole mouthpart
   abnormalities, data relating feeding kinematics of tadpoles with missing
   labial teeth are relevant in assessing the impact these abnormalities
   have on larval performance. Our data indicate that tadpoles missing
   labial teeth forage less effectively than tadpoles with undamaged
   dentition. This may help explain the pattern of reduced growth and
   developmental rates commonly observed in tadpoles raised in polluted
   environments or infected with pathogens that attack keratinized oral
   structures.

AB Chytridiomycosis is a disease of amphibians caused by the fungus
   Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), which colonizes keratinized tissues
   in adult and larval amphibians. Considerable progress has been made in
   understanding the host-pathogen ecology of Bd in larval anurans, yet
   little is known about how Bd affects larval salamanders. Because the
   structure of keratinized jaw sheaths in Ambystoma larvae have not been
   thoroughly documented, we first described the structure in three species
   of larval Ambystoma. We then conducted a laboratory experiment to test
   if Bd affects growth and developmental rates of larval Marbled
   Salamanders (Ambystoma opacum). We observed keratinized jaw sheaths in
   all three species of Ambystoma, but the sheath was not present in all
   individuals. In our exposure experiment, none of the A. opacum, whose
   mouthparts were screened for Bd, tested positive, nor was there an
   effect of Bd on larval life-history responses. A cautionary note,
   however, is that although our method of Bd infection has been successful
   in other amphibian-Bd experiments in our laboratory, our exposure
   experiment did not include a positive control of other taxa known to
   become infected with Bd. We are uncertain why none of the larval A.
   opacum became infected with Bd, given that we observed keratinized jaw
   sheaths in this species. Two possible explanations are the keratinized
   jaw sheaths of larval Ambystoma differ among species in structure or
   keratin type so that Bd may not be able to successfully infect them or,
   A. opacum larvae may have cleared low intensity Bd infections prior to
   metamorphosis.

AB Pathogens can alter host life-history traits by affecting host feeding
   activities. In anuran tadpoles, keratinized mouthparts (teeth and jaw
   sheaths) are essential for feeding. Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd)
   is a pathogenic fungus of amphibians that can infect these mouthparts
   and reduce tadpole survival. However, the precise way that Bd-induced
   changes in tadpole mouthparts impact tadpole feeding is unknown. We use
   high-speed (500 frames/sec) videoaraphy to study how Bd-inducecl
   mouthpart deformities affect the feeding kinematics of Fowler's toad
   (Anoxyrus [= Bufo] fowleri) and grey tree frog (Hyla chrysoscelis)
   tadpoles. We tested for species-specific patterns of Bd-induced
   mouthpart deformities to assess how deformations to specific areas of
   tadpole mouthparts alter feeding kinematics. The teeth of tadpoles from
   the Bd-exposed treatment slipped off of surfaces on which tadpoles graze
   and were in contact with an algal-covered substratum for a shorter
   duration in each gape cycle compared to teeth of control tadpoles. We
   also found that the jaw sheaths had significantly more deformations than
   labial teeth; however, how this relates to feeding kinematics is
   unclear. Our data show explicitly how Bd infection reduces foraging
   efficiency of anuran tadpoles by altering feeding kinematics and
   elucidate a mechanistic link between the pathogen infection and reduced
   host fitness.

AB Recent studies have explored feeding kinematics in tadpoles with intact

   We explored the impact of missing labial teeth on the feeding mechanics
   and foraging performance of Southern leopard frog (Lithobates

   pattern of labial tooth loss; that is, by surgically removing one row of
   labial teeth. We then used high-speed (500 frames/second) videography to
   test the hypothesis that tooth loss reduces the time that tadpoles
   attach to and graze upon an algal-covered substrate. We next conducted
   trials of foraging efficiency and foraging activity to test the
   hypothesis that tadpoles with fewer teeth forage less effectively than
   control tadpoles. The teeth of tadpoles from the surgery treatment
   slipped while closing and were in contact with an algal-covered
   substrate for a shorter duration compared to control tadpoles.
   Surprisingly, tadpoles with missing labial teeth obtained similar
   amounts of food and were as active as tadpoles with intact mouth-parts.
   However, tadpoles with missing teeth completed about 25% more gape
   cycles per unit time than control tadpoles. Our data suggest that
   tadpoles with missing teeth compensate for inferior feeding kinematics
   during mouth closing in each gape cycle by increasing the number of gape
   cycles per unit time.

AB Pathogen-induced modifications in host behavior, including alterations
   in foraging behavior or foraging efficiency, can compromise host fitness
   by reducing growth and development. Chytridiomycosis is an infectious
   disease of amphibians caused by the fungus Batrachochytrium
   dendrobatidis (Bd), and it has played an important role in the worldwide
   decline of amphibians. In larval anurans, Bd infections commonly result
   in reduced developmental rates, however, the mechanism(s) responsible
   are untested. We conducted laboratory experiments to test whether Bd
   infections reduced foraging performance of Grey Treefrog (Hyla
   chrysoscelis) and Fowler's Toad (Anaxyrus [= Bufo] fowleri) tadpoles. In
   the first experiment, we observed foraging behavior of Bd-infected and
   uninfected tadpoles to test for differences in foraging activity. In a
   second experiment, we tested for differences in the ingestion rates of
   tadpoles by examining the amount of food in their alimentary track after
   a 3-hour foraging period. We hypothesized that Bd-infected tadpoles
   would forage less often and less efficiently than uninfected tadpoles.
   As predicted, Bd-infected larvae forage less often and were less
   efficient at obtaining food than uninfected larvae. Our results show
   that Bd infections reduce foraging efficiency in Anaxyrus and Hyla
   tadpoles, and that Bd differentially affects foraging behavior in these
   species. Thus, our results provide a potential mechanism of decreased
   developmental rates of Bd-infected tadpoles.

   environmental factors are largely responsible for differences in larval
   period, mass and size at metamorphosis between the two forms of A.
   barbouri however. it is unclear which environmental factors influence
   the variation. Under controlled laboratory conditions, we tested if
   hydrological differences between lotic and lentic habitats contribute to
   life history divergence in A. barbouri. We reared laboratory born larvae
   from stream- and pond-collected eggs in laboratory environments with
   hydrological patterns similar to their natal environments. Ambystoma
   barbouri stream larvae metamorphosed faster and were smaller in mass and
   size compared to pond larvae. Although we did not test Whether genetic
   or environmental factors influence larval life history traits, our data
   provide support that hydrological variation alone may contribute to tire
   life history variation ill the two forms of larval A. barbouri.

   along with two native anurans, the Squirrel Treefrog (Hyla squirella)
   and the Southern Toad (Bufo terrestris) in both experimental artificial
   ponds and laboratory aquaria, the role of competition as the mechanism
   driving the dynamics of invaded amphibian communities in Florida was

   between pond locations in altering interactions between O.
   septentrionalis and native anuran larvae. Interspecific competition was
   strong during the larval stage; the presence of O. septentrionalis
   reduced larval performance and survival of native anurans. Pond location
   alone had little effect on interspecific interactions, but priority
   effects were strong. Pond location and priority effects acted together
   to influence species interactions. The selective influence of different

AB The costs of spermatogenesis constrain sperm expenditure when sperm
   production per day is limited. Thus, males are challenged to allocate
   available resources to sperm production and other life history
   functions. However, this prevailing assumption is not applicable to
   species in which spermatogenesis becomes quiescent during the breeding
   season. Males of these species prepare large quantities of sperm before
   the breeding season. Among these species, constraints on ejaculates have
   been intensively investigated in salamanders that deposit
   spermatophores. Although it is predicted that sperm expenditure should
   not be limited because of abundantly prepared sperm, spermatophore
   deposition is often limited during the breeding season when vas deferens
   are full of sperm. We tested a hypothesis regarding limited
   spermatophore deposition by measuring sperm quantity and volume of
   spermatophores sequentially deposited by male eastern newts
   Notophthalmus viridescens. A male newt rarely deposits more than three
   spermatophores per mating. If depletion of non-sperm components of
   spermatophores limits spermatophore deposition, we predicted that
   spermatophore volume decreases while sperm quantity remains constant as
   a male deposits more spermatophores. Alternatively, some regulative
   mechanisms allow a limited portion of available sperm to be expended per
   mating, in which sperm quantity is predicted to decrease while the
   spermatophore volume remains constant. Finally, depletion of non-sperm
   components may regulate sperm expenditure, which predicted that both
   spermatophore volume and sperm quantity decrease. We found that both
   sperm quantity and the spermatophore volume decreased as a male
   deposited more spermatophores during a single mating. Sperm expenditure
   was constrained without the costs involved in active spermatogenesis,
   and depletion of non-sperm components likely regulate sperm quantity
   loaded in spermatophores. In dissociated spermatogenesis, constrained
   sperm expenditure do not mean that costly spermatogenesis is directly
   limiting male mating capacity but rather suggest that the evolution of
   physiological mechanisms regulating sperm expenditure per mating
   maximizes male reproductive success.

AB Polyphenism, which allows a single genotype to express multiple discrete
   phenotypes in response to environmental cues, is an adaptive trait in
   heterogeneous environments. Pond hydroperiod is an important ecological
   parameter affecting amphibian life history, and variation in local pond
   hydrology has been hypothesized to play a role in species divergence via
   changes in polyphenism. The eastern newt (Notophthalmus viridescens)
   expresses life cycle polyphenism. Larvae develop along three possible
   pathways: metamorphosis to aquatic lunged adult via a terrestrial
   juvenile (eft) stage, metamorphosis directly to an aquatic lunged adult,
   or maturation directly to an aquatic gilled adult without metamorphosis
   (i.e., paedomorphosis). Subspecies of N. viridescens vary in their
   polyphenic patterns, suggesting possible adaptation to different
   environments. However, no studies have experimentally tested how genetic
   and environmental components contribute to the observed differences
   among subspecies and whether such differences may facilitate divergence.
   We tested whether adaptation to local pond hydrology via polyphenic
   changes existed among subspecies by rearing larvae of three subspecies
   (N. v. dorsalis, N. v. louisianensis, and N. v. viridescens) along three
   hydroperiod regimes (short, long, and constant) in outdoor artificial
   ponds. We found that larval N. v. viridescens obligately metamorphosed
   to efts under all hydroperiods, whereas N. v. dorsalis and N. v.
   louisianensis exhibited plasticity: larvae metamorphosed to efts under
   drying conditions but metamorphosed directly to aquatic adults or became
   paedomorphic in constant water. Also, N. v. viridescens metamorphosed to
   efts faster and at a smaller body size than the other two subspecies.
   These data suggest that subspecies of N. viridescens are adapted to
   different pond hydroperiods, supporting the potential for polyphenism to
   facilitate divergence. Canalizing selection for certain alternative
   phenotypes within a single species in which other populations remain
   plastic may play an important role in the initiation of ecological
   divergence.

AB Distinguishing whether pathogens are novel or endemic is critical for
   controlling emerging infectious diseases, an increasing threat to
   wildlife and human health. To test the endemic vs. novel pathogen
   hypothesis, we present a unique analysis of intraspecific host-pathogen
   phylogenetic concordance of tiger salamanders and an emerging Ranavirus
   throughout Western North America. There is significant non-concordance
   of host and virus gene trees, suggesting pathogen novelty. However,
   non-concordance has likely resulted from virus introductions by human
   movement of infected salamanders. When human-associated viral
   introductions are excluded, host and virus gene trees are identical,
   strongly supporting coevolution and endemism. A laboratory experiment
   showed an introduced virus strain is significantly more virulent than
   endemic strains, likely due to artificial selection for high virulence.
   Thus, our analysis of intraspecific phylogenetic concordance revealed
   that human introduction of viruses is the mechanism underlying tree
   non-concordance and possibly disease emergence via artificial selection.

   Pessier & Nichols, a pathogen implicated in global amphibian population
   declines, on antipredator behavior of northern leopard frog (Rana
   pipiens Schreber, 1782) tadpoles in response to visual and chemical cues
   of a fish predator, bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus Rafinesque,
   1819). We placed infected and uninfected tadpoles in containers
   partitioned with a transparent divider and measured tadpole activity and
   distance from the center. Infected tadpoles had significantly lower
   activity levels across all treatments. When exposed to only visual cues,
   uninfected tadpoles positioned themselves farther from the center
   divider (and thus the predator) than infected animals. All tadpoles were
   at similar distances from the center when exposed to chemical cues only,
   likely because chemical cues alone do not provide spatial information on
   the location of predators. Infected tadpoles were significantly farther
   from the center divider than uninfected ones when exposed to visual and
   chemical cues together, suggesting that, although the mechanism is
   unknown, both cues are necessary to stimulate predator avoidance
   behavior for infected animals. In a second experiment, infected tadpoles
   experienced lower mortality than uninfected ones in the lethal presence
   of fish. Thus, effects of infection on behavioral antipredator responses
   are complex, but lower host susceptibility to predation, low activity,
   and greater distance from predators when both chemical and visual
   predator cues are present likely benefits B. dendrobatidis, which relies
   on host survival for transmission.

AB We tested whether the presence of an iridovirus (Ambystoma tigrinum
   virus; ATV) could alter patterns of larval life histories in Arizona
   Tiger Salamanders (Ambystoma tigrinum nebulosum). Viral epidemics cause
   extreme mortality in natural populations and, thus, impose a strong
   selective force. We tested how exposure to ATV during larval development
   influences survival, growth, and frequency of cannibalism by
   manipulating the presence of ATV in replicated experimental tanks. ATV
   significantly reduced survival and larval growth. Propensity to become
   cannibalistic was not related to ATV exposure, suggesting that
   salamanders cannot facultatively respond to the presence of diseased
   conspecifics by reducing cannibalism. Our results demonstrate that viral
   pathogens may have both a direct and indirect effect on A. tigrinum
   fitness by reducing survival and growth rate.

   studies have identified chytridiomycosis as an emerging infections
   disease, whose widespread occurence poses a significant risk for
   amphibian populations. We manipulated the presence of B. dendrobatidis
   in replicated experimental tanks and examined if exposure to this fungus
   during development could influence recruitment and competitive
   interactions between larval Bufo and Hyla. Tanks were followed
   throughout larval development, and we recorded survival. time to
   metamorphosis. and body mass at metamorphosis. We also tested the
   effects of competitive and pathogen-mediated stress on developmental
   stability by measuring fluctuating asymmetry (FA) of surviving
   metamorphs. B. dendrobatidis had no significant effect on larval
   survival, but the pathogen reduced metamorphic body mass and increased
   larval-period length. B. dendrobatidis had different effects oil larval
   growth depending on the community sructure; in the presence of the
   pathogen, both Bufo and Hyla metamorphosed at smaller body masses when
   reared together compared to when reared separately. Bit also had strong
   negative effects oil Hyla development, but Only in the presence of B.
   dendrobatidis. FA of hind-limb length was significantly higher for
   metamorphs front pathogen tanks, but was not associated with density or
   competitive environment. Our results suggest that chytridiomycosis may
   impact Bufo and Hyla directly by reducing life-history performance and
   increasing developmental instability, and indirectly by inducing
   interspecific competitive effects in mixed-species environments.

AB Pathogens can alter host behavior and affect the outcome of
   predator-prey interactions. Acute phase responses of hosts (e.g., a
   change in activity level or behavioral fever) often signal an infection,
   but the ecological consequences of host behavioral changes largely are
   unexplored, particularly for directly transmitted (i.e., single-host)
   pathogens. We performed three experiments to test the hypothesis that a
   pathogen, Ambystoma tigrinum virus (ATV), alters host behavior of
   Sonoran tiger salamanders (Ambystoma tigrinum stebbinsi Lowe, 1954) and
   enhances predation. In the first experiment, salamander larvae exposed
   to ATV experienced 48% lower mortality from dragonfly Anax junius
   (Drury, 1773) larvae than those in controls. Second, uninfected and
   infected larvae exposed to the nonlethal (caged) presence of predators
   did not significantly differ in their distance from the predator.
   Infected salamanders significantly increased their activity level
   relative to those in controls in predator-free conditions. Finally,
   ATV-infected larvae preferred significantly warmer temperatures than
   uninfected larvae, but larvae reared at the thermal maximum for the
   virus all died. High host activity level yet retention of effective
   antipredator responses likely benefits ATV because this single-host
   pathogen relies on host survival for transmission. Preference for warmer
   temperatures may be associated with the host response to pathogens and
   may help fight infection.

AB Despite ecologists increasingly recognizing pathogens as playing
   significant roles in community dynamics, few experimental studies have
   quantified patterns of disease impacts on natural systems. Amphibians
   are experiencing population declines, and a fungal pathogen
   (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis; Chytridiomycota) is a suspected causal
   agent in many declines. We studied the effects of a pathogenic fungus on
   community interactions between the gray treefrog, Hyla chrysoscelis, and
   eastern newts, Notophthalmus viridescens. Recent studies have
   characterized chytridiomycosis as an emerging infectious disease, whose
   suspected rapid range expansion and widespread occurrence pose a
   significant risk for amphibian populations worldwide. We reared larvae
   in outdoor polyethylene experimental tanks and tested the effects of
   initial larval density, predator presence, and fungal exposure on Hyla
   recruitment and predator-prey interactions between Hyla and
   Notophthalmus. Newts reduced treefrog survival, and high intraspecific
   density decreased metamorphic body mass independent of B. dendrobatidis.
   The presence of fungi reduced treefrog body mass at metamorphosis by
   34%, but had no significant main effect on survival or larval period
   length. B. dendrobatidis differentially affected larval development in
   the presence of predators; Hyla developed slower when reared with the
   pathogen, but only when newts were present. This significant
   predator-by-pathogen interaction suggests that the impact of
   chytridiomycosis on larval amphibians may be exacerbated in complex
   communities. Our data suggest that B. dendrobatidis effects on host life
   history may be complex and indirect. Direct measurements of the
   community-level effects of pathogens offer an important opportunity to
   understand a significant threat to global biodiversity-declining
   amphibian populations.

AB Interspecific hybridization can affect fitness-related traits, such as

   the effects of pathogens on host fitness in hybrid zones, particularly
   in animal systems. I used a system of hybridizing leopard frogs to test
   for differences in response to disease as a function of genetic
   admixture. I raised F-1 hybrid and parental genotypes between Rana
   blairi (plains leopard frog) and Rana sphenocephala (southern leopard
   frog) in replicated experimental tanks, and tested the effect of an
   emergent amphibian pathogen, chytrid fungi (Batrachochlytrium
   dendrobatidis), on larval growth and development. Chytrid did not have a
   significant effect on larval survival for any genotype. Chytrids reduced
   body mass at metamorphosis and increased duration of the larval period
   for all genotypes. F-1 hybrids experienced smaller metamorphic body
   masses and longer larval periods than both parental genotypes, but only
   in chytrid environments. Significantly, more F, hybrids were infected
   than either parental species. These results indicate that interspecific
   hybridization may produce relatively fit hybrid genotypes in
   pathogen-free conditions, but hybrids suffer decreased performance in
   the presence of chytrids. Such results suggest that hybridization
   between divergent amphibian lineages may produce hybrid genotypes with a
   reduced ability to cope with emergent pathogens.

AB Predicting the ecological and evolutionary significance of hybridization
   depends on accurate and comprehensive measurements of the relative
   fitness of hybrid and parental genotypes under realistic environmental
   scenarios. Although matings between genetically distinct individuals may
   produce hybrid progeny of lower fitness than matings between genetically
   similar individuals, this is not always the case. Two species of North
   American leopard frogs (Rana blairi and R. sphenocephala) hybridize in
   central Missouri. To examine the relationship between genotypic fitness
   and the environment, I measured larval fitness components of the two
   leopard frog species and their interspecific hybrids using transplant
   experiments in field enclosures. This study was undertaken to compare
   larval fitness components of R. blairi, R. sphenocephala, and F-1
   hybrids in three natural aquatic habitats representative of a natural
   environmental gradient (prairie, woodland, and river floodplain). Larvae
   were reared either in single-genotype stands or in mixtures of all three
   genotypes. There was no evidence of reduced F-1 hybrid larval
   performance in any environment. In fact. F-1 hybrids metamorphosed
   larger than R. sphenocephala, but not R. blairi, in the river floodplain
   habitat. All genotypes produced the highest proportion of individuals
   surviving and metamorphosing in the floodplain habitat. Thus, hybrid
   genotypes performed equivalently to or better than their parental
   species in three aquatic habitat types. Transplant experiments such as
   these are critical for directly measuring genotype-by-environment
   interactions and for assessing the role of ecological factors in
   determining the adaptive potential of natural hybridization.

   frogs were obtained from larvae reared in experimental ponds. Following

   rates of advanced-generation hybrids equal to those of the parental

   between adults collected from a natural population sympatric with these
   predators in central Missouri. After hatching, larvae were reared in
   single-genotype groups in outdoor experimental wading pools for 14 days.
   A higher proportion of R. sphenocephala survived than did R. blairi, and
   F(1) hybrids did not differ significantly in survival from either
   parental genotype. Fish predation was severe for all genotypes and
   reduced survival to a greater degree than other predators. Body mass did
   not differ significantly among genotypes or predator treatments.
   Relatively high survival and growth for F(1) hybrid larvae suggests
   natural hybridization between R. blairi and R. sphenocephala can produce
   novel and relatively fit hybrid genotypes that can cope with predators
   just as successfully as parental genotypes. Furthermore, low survival of
   all genotypes in experimental pools containing fish is consistent with
   the observation that leopard frog larvae do not normally coexist with
   fish.

AB Although hybrid zones between North American leopard frog species pairs
   (Rana pipiens complex) are usually narrow, the contact zone between R
   blairi and R sphenocephala varies from sharp parapatry to relatively
   broad sympatry. I compared fitness components using larval life-history
   traits for R blairi, R sphenocephala and F-1 hybrid genotypes from Texas
   populations where the hybrid zone is sharply parapatric, and genotypes
   from Missouri populations where hybridization occurs in broadly
   sympatric areas. Texas F-1 hybrids had significantly reduced survival
   and metamorphosis relative to Missouri F-1 hybrids. Texas hybrids also
   demonstrated reduced performance in terms of survival, body mass and
   metamorphosis when reared in experimental populations with R
   sphenocephala or both parental species, but not R. blairi alone. Larval
   fitness estimates as measured by survival, body mass at metamorphosis,
   proportion of survivors metamorphosing and length of larval period for
   Missouri F-1 hybrids were equal or higher than those of their parental
   genotypes in all mixtures. These patterns suggest selection may be
   dependent on the larval rearing environment and strongest against hybrid
   genotypes in the southern region of the hybrid zone (Texas), but not
   directional against F-1 hybrids in the northern region (Missouri). Thus,
   fitness data from a single location within hybrid zones may lead to
   inaccurate conclusions concerning the evolutionary potential of
   hybridization.

AB Relative fitness of parental and hybrid Leopard Frogs was examined by
   measuring larval performance in artificial ponds and laboratory
   containers. Effect of a variable hydroperiod on growth, development, and
   survival was used to assess larval responses to a desiccating aquatic
   environment. Larvae for the artificial pond experiment were obtained
   from field-collected egg masses of Rana blairi and R. sphenocephala.
   Artificial crosses with adult animals produced larvae of one parental
   and three hybrid genotypes for laboratory performance assays.
   Experimental pond drying significantly reduced survival for both
   parental species. Rana blairi had higher survival than R. sphenocephala
   across all treatments. Both species reduced larval period lengths when
   exposed to a drying environment relative to constant water levels. The
   laboratory experiment revealed Backcross2 hybrid larvae exhibited longer
   larval period lengths than parental R. sphenocephala and certain F1
   hybrid genotypes in the drying environment. Proportion of survivors
   metamorphosing was greatest for the F1 hybrid genotype SB and lowest for
   the Backcross2 hybrid genotype. Consequently, advanced-generation hybrid
   genotypes (i.e., Backcross2) did not perform well in desiccating
   environments. Direct measurements of important fitness components of
   parental and hybrid genotypes are critical for determining the
   evolutionary potential of natural hybridization.

AB Recognizing the predominant mode of selection in hybrid systems is
   important in predicting the evolutionary fate of recombinant genotypes.
   Natural selection is endogenous if hybrid genotypes are at a
   disadvantage relative to parental species independent of environment.
   Alternatively, relative fitness can vary in response to environmental
   variation (exogenous selection), and hybrid genotypes can possess
   fitness values equal to or greater than that of parental species. I
   investigated the nature of natural selection in a leopard frog hybrid
   system by rearing larvae of hybrid and parental genotypes between Rana
   blairi and R. sphenocephala in 1000-L outdoor experimental ponds. Three
   hybrid (F-1, backcross(1) [B-1], backcross(2) [B-2]) and two parental
   (R. blairi [BB] and R. sphenocephala [SS]) larval genotypes were
   produced by artificial fertilzations using adult frogs from a natural
   population in central Missouri. Resultant larvae were reared in
   single-genotype populations and two-way mixtures at equal total numbers
   from hatching to metamorphosis. In single-genotype ponds, F-1 hybrid
   larvae had highest survival and BE were largest at metamorphosis. When
   F-1 and SS larvae were mixed together, F-1 hybrids had reduced survival
   and both F-1 and SS larvae metamorphosed at larger body masses than when
   reared separately. When mixed, both B-1 and SS larvae had shorter larval
   period lengths than when reared alone. Higher proportion of B-1
   metamorphs were produced when larvae were mixed with either parental
   species than when reared alone. Larval fitness components as measured by
   survival, body mass at metamorphosis, proportion of survivors
   metamorphosing, and larval period length for B-1 hybrid and BB larvae
   were similar in single-genotype populations and mixtures. Comparison of
   composite fitness component estimates indicated hybrid genotypes possess
   equivalent or higher larval fitness relative to both parental species
   for the life-history fitness components measured. Despite reduced
   survival of F-1 hybrids in mixtures, backcross-generation hybrid
   genotypes demonstrated high levels of larval growth, survival, and
   metamorphosis in mixtures with parental species. Consequently, this
   study suggests natural hybridization and subsequent backcrossing between
   R. blairi and R. sphenocephala can produce novel and relatively fit
   hybrid genotypes capable of successful existence with parental species
   larvae. Thus, the evolutionary fate of hybrid and parental genotypes in
   this system may be influenced by exogenous selection mediated by
   genotypic composition of larval assemblages.

AB Differential fitness between hybrid and parental genotypes plays a
   critical role in explaining the maintenance of natural hybrid zones as
   well as the production of novel genetic variation that may lead to
   diversification. Because locomotor performance is a reliable and
   practical measure of potential fitness related to morphological
   variation, we tested for differences in jumping performance among
   parental and hybrid genotypes of newly metamorphosed leopard frogs (Rana
   sphenocephala and Rana blairi). Tadpoles of the parental species and
   primary and backcross hybrid tadpoles, generated from artificial crosses
   (a total of five genotypes), were reared at two initial larval
   densities. Locomotor performance of newly metamorphosed frogs, as
   measured by jumping ability, was tested three times over 6 days in the
   laboratory at 24-25 degrees C. Maximum and average jump lengths were
   greater for metamorphs reared at low larval density than for those
   reared at high density. Regression analyses indicated that 70-79% of the
   variation in jump length was due to body mass. When reared at low
   density, metamorphs of two F-1 backcross genotypes (HB and HS) and one
   primary hybrid genotype (SB) jumped shorter distances than either
   parental species. When reared at high density, hybrid performance was
   indistinguishable from that of the parentals, except for one backcross
   hybrid (HB). Moderately high short-term repeatabilities (0.47-0.66) of
   metamorphs reared at the high density indicate that measures of
   performance in newly metamorphosed frogs can be predictive. We suggest
   that, owing to poor jumping performance, some hybrid frogs would be at a
   selective disadvantage relative to their parental species in the
   terrestrial environment and thus would partially reinforce mechanisms of
   reproductive isolation in this leopard frog system. Yet equivalent
   performance of some hybrids relative to the parentals, at least when
   reared at low density, suggests that hybrid lineages also have the
   potential to evolve independently in some environments.

AB I examined the burrowing performance of newly metamorphosed Rana
   areolata, Rana blairi, and Rana sphenocephala in laboratory aquaria.
   Three treatments were used to determine whether metamorphs, when
   deprived of a water source, actively dig their own burrows, and if they
   utilize natural irregularities in substrate profiles or preexisting
   burrows as shelter from evaporative desiccation. Analysis of covariance
   (initial body mass covariate) revealed that individuals of all three
   species actively burrowed and passively utilized preexisting
   experimental burrows, but active burrowing, which consisted of substrate
   excavation using only the hind limbs, took much longer. Metamorphs that
   used preexisting burrows conserved water more efficiently than those
   that actively dug their own burrows. Rana blairi experienced the highest
   percent water loss across all treatments and was the only species to
   suffer mortality during the experiment. These data suggest that
   burrowing, by minimizing evaporative water loss, may be a critical
   adaptive behavior for metamorphic frogs in semi-arid environments.

AB Asymmetric competition in larval amphibians can influence population
   dynamics and community structure. This density-dependent regulatory
   mechanism may be of particular importance for rare or endangered species
   such as the northern crawfish frog, Rana areolata circulosa.
   Interspecific competition of R. areolata with two congenerics, R. blairi
   and R. sphenocephala, was examined in artificial ponds. Analysis of
   covariance (differential mortality covariate) indicated that
   interspecific competition increased larval period length and decreased
   metamorphic body mass of R. areolata. The number of metamorphs produced
   was lower for R. blairi ponds when reared with R. areolata at high
   density. Body mass at metamorphosis was larger for R. sphenocephala when
   reared with R. areolata, suggesting that R. areolata facilitates larval
   growth in R. sphenocephala. These results indicate that the larval
   performance of R. areolata was reduced in the presence of interspecific
   competitors. Although many conservation efforts emphasize the
   preservation of critical habitat or particular rare species, interactive
   effects of biotic components in the focal community may also be
   important demographic regulators.
