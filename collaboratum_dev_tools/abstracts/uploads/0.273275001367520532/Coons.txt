AB We studied the effects of tick saliva on cell migration, cell signaling,
   phagocytosis, and gene expression in the murine macrophage cell line,
   IC-21. Saliva increased both basal- and platelet-derived growth factor
   (PDGF)-stimulated migration in IC-21 cells. However, saliva did not
   affect PDGF-stimulated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)
   activity. Zymosan-mediated interleukin-1 receptor associated kinase
   (IRAK) activity increased when cells were pretreated with saliva. Saliva
   suppressed phagocytosis of zymosan particles by IC-21 cells. An RT(2)
   Profiler (TM) PCR Array revealed that saliva regulates gene expression
   in a manner consistent with an immune response skewed toward a Th2
   reaction, which is characterized by production of anti-inflammatory
   cytokines IL-4 and IL-10. Our results using IC-21 cells suggest that
   Dermacentor variabilis has evolved a mechanism for regulating macrophage
   function, which may contribute to the tick's ability to modulate immune
   function. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Enzyme immunosorbent assays were used to measure cyclic nucleotide
   concentrations in homogenates of salivary glands from partially fed
   female Dermacentor variabilis. The adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin
   (100 mu M) increased homogenate cGMP concentrations greater than
   three-fold over controls. Competitive inhibition of nitric oxide
   synthase with 1 MM L-NMMA, an L-arginine analog, demonstrated that
   crosstalk occurs downstream of nitric oxide synthesis.
   Forskolin-stimulated synthesis of cGMP was diminished 58% by the soluble
   guanylyl cyclase inhibitor CDQ (2 mu M). The protein kinase A selective
   inhibitor Rp-cAMPS (50 mu M) inhibited forskolin-stimulated cGMP by 49%.
   Whole glands treated with 10 mu M dopamine increased cGMP levels
   two-fold in the presence of I mM IBMX. Treatment of whole salivary
   glands with equimolar concentrations of 8-Br-cAMP and 8-Br-cGMP produced
   no greater fluid uptake than in glands treated with 8-Br-cGMP alone,
   suggesting that cAMP and cGMP share a downstream target. The protein
   kinase G-selective inhibitor Rp-8-pCPT-cGMPS (100 mu M) impeded 10 mM
   8-Bromo-cGMP-stimulated gland weight increases. Pretreatment with
   verapamil, a Ca(2+) channel blocker, attenuated cyclic
   nucleotide-stimulated fluid uptake indicating that whole gland fluid
   changes are dependent on extracellular Ca(2+). Together, our data
   suggest that cGMP production is mediated in part by cAMP-dependent
   activation of soluble guanylyl cyclase. Experiments measuring changes in
   whole salivary gland weight support the hypothesis that cAMP and cGMP
   signaling cascades have a common target and that cyclic
   nucleotide-stimulated fluid movement is dependent on Ca(2+) influx. (C)

AB Previous morphological and histochemical studies of argasid tick
   salivary glands indicated that they were less complex than ixodid
   salivary glands, with only three granular cell types. The present study
   shows that there exist at least four different granular cell types in
   the salivary glands of the argasid tick Ornithodoros savignyi, based on
   immuno-localization of the anti-hemostatic factors, apyrase and
   savignygrin. Both anti-hemostatic factors were localized to dense core
   granule type 'a' and to granule type 'b', that shares a similar
   homogenous morphology with non-labeled granule type 'd'. Furthermore,
   the major tick salivary gland proteins (TSGPs), previously implicated in
   granule biogenesis, were localized to all the granular cell types. This
   indicates that granular cell types with different morphologies can
   express the same proteins, while cell types that show similar
   morphologies may not express the same proteins. Argasid tick salivary
   glands seem to be more complex than previously thought and might not be
   amenable to morphological classification alone. Alternative
   classification methodologies that rely on physical expression patterns
   of the salivary gland proteome might be more reliable as markers for a
   specific granular cell type.

AB We used pharmacological methods to test the hypothesis that female
   Dermacentor variabilis salivary ducts dilated when dopamine-stimulated
   and that dilation was nitric oxide-mediated. Stimulation with dopamine
   resulted in an increased diameter (19.7%) compared to unstimulated ducts
   (P<0.005). Pretreatment with L-NAME, an inhibitor of nitric oxide
   synthase, or cytochalasin D abolished the dilation. Addition of
   L-arginine to L-NAME-treated ducts partially restored the ability to
   dilate. A cuticular coil composed of a series of concentric rings ran
   the length of the duct adjacent to the epithelial cell layer. In
   stimulated ducts, the center-to-center periodicity of these rings
   increased from 0.59 mu m in unfed ducts to 1.0 mu m from partially fed
   ducts (P<0.05). When the ducts from partially fed females were
   stimulated with dopamine, the periodicity increased further to 1.75 mu m
   (P<0.05), suggesting the coils moved further apart in response to
   stimulation. Prominent folds lining the lumen of unstimulated ducts were
   less pronounced in stimulated preparations, suggesting that the cuticle
   stretches, thereby increasing lumen size. Actin was localized in
   epithelial cells as a honeycomb pattern that we suggest links the
   epithelial cells to the rings. Together, these data support the
   following hypothesis: stimulated ducts dilated during fluid production;
   dilation involved an actin-based system, and was mediated by nitric
   oxide. Dilation of the duct may enhance its role as a reservoir for
   saliva produced by the acini during the period between imbibition and
   salivation. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We colocalized nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity in epithelial cells
   that surround the salivary gland duct in female Dermacentor variabilis
   with NADPH diaphorase histochemistry and immunohistochemistry using a
   polyclonal antiendothelial NOS. Using size-exclusion chromatography, a
   fraction with a molecular mass of about 185 kDa that had diaphorase
   activity was eluted from tick; salivary gland homogenate. This fraction
   converted arginine to citrulline with the production of nitric oxide
   (NO), which was detected by using electron spin resonance spectroscopy.
   The complete activity of the diaphorase fraction was dependent on NADPH,
   FAD, tetrahydrobiopterin, calmodulin, (CaM), and Ca2+, but was not
   dependent on dithiothreitol. The arginine analog
   N-G-monomethyl-L-arginine inhibited the activity of this fraction. NO
   and arginine activated soluble guanylate cyclase to produce cGMP in
   dopamine-stimulated isolated salivary glands. Dopamine-stimulated
   isolated salivary glands treated with tick saline containing either
   EDTA, the NOS inhibitor N-G-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, or the
   calcium/CaM binding inhibitor W-7 showed no increase in cGMP. The NO
   donor sodium nitroprusside significantly increased cGMP levels in
   unstimulated isolated salivary glands. A possible function for NO in
   salivation by this ixodid tick is discussed. (C) 2000 Academic Press.

   analogue methoprene (JHA) on vitellogenin (Vg) production in fat body
   organ cultures and backless explants of unfed female Demacentor
   variabilis was measured. An indirect double antibody enzyme linked
   immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed using a monoclonal antibody
   that recognized a 98 kDa subunit of Vg and a Vg specific polyclonal
   antibody made against vitellin (Vn). Peak Vg titers in culture medium
   from fat body cultures treated with 0.1 mu M 20HE or 1 mu M 20HE were 24
   ng/ml and 20 ng/ml respectively. In culture medium from backless
   explants treated with 0.1 mu M 20HE or 1 mu M 20HE, peak Vg titers were
   36 ng/ml and 26 ng/ml, respectively. JHA produced only a slight increase
   in Vg titers that was statistically different from Vg titers produced by
   20HE but was not statistically different from hormone-free controls.
   These results support the conclusion that Vg production in fat body
   trophocytes of D. variabilis is regulated by 20HE. (C) 1999 Elsevier

AB A novel inhibitor of human platelet aggregation, named variabilin, was
   isolated from salivary glands of the hard tick Dermacentor variabilis
   using a combination of gel filtration and high pressure liquid
   chromatography, Variabilin was a potent antagonist of the fibrinogen
   receptor glycoprotein IIb-IIIa (GPIIb-IIIa; alpha(IIb)beta(3)) and the
   vitronectin receptor alpha(v) beta(3). Amino acid sequence analysis by
   Edman degradation revealed that it has 47 residues, with a molecular
   weight of 4968.5. Like many other naturally occurring antagonists of
   GPIIb-IIIa, variabilin contains the RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) motif. However,
   unlike the RGD-containing antagonists of GPIIb-IIIa, the RGD sequence of
   variabilin is not positioned in a loop bracketed by cysteine residues,
   It has little sequence homology to the other known naturally occurring
   antagonists of GPIIb-IIIa, including the disintegrins from snakes,
   decorsin and ornatin from leeches, and disagregin from soft ticks.
   Variabilin is the first RGD containing antagonist isolated from ticks.

AB A complementary DNA clone from salivary glands of feeding female
   Amblyomma americanum ticks has been characterized as encoding
   calreticulin. Calreticulin, a major endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
   calcium-binding protein, appears to be secreted in Amblyomma and
   Dermacentor saliva. Evidence is accummulating that calreticulin performs
   roles unrelated to calcium storage, Unlike most known calreticulins,
   tick-secreted calreticulin lacks the ER retention signal, KDEL. This is
   the first molecular cloning of a specific tick salivary gland protein.
   The finding of a secreted calreticulin in tick saliva suggests a role

AB Type III acini from feeding female Dermacentor variabilis varied in size
   during in vitro and in vivo fluid production. As the type III acinus
   enlarged, its lumen enlarged and the adlumenal cell became thinner. As
   the acinus contracted, its lumen became smaller while the adlumenal cell
   became wider. Actin was demonstrated in salivary glands using an
   immunoblot technique. Actin was localized in the adlumenal cells of type
   III acini with fluorescent microscopy using rhodamine-phalloidin and
   with electron microscopy using heavy meromyosin to decorate actin
   filaments. Pre-treatment of salivary glands with cytochalasin D
   abolished fluorescence in adlumenal cells subsequently treated with
