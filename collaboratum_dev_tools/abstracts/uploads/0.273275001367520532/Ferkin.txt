AB Many terrestrial mammals will choose the path that contains evidence of
   conspecifics with whom they would like to encounter, such as a potential
   mate, while avoiding a path that will lead them to encounter a threat,
   such as a same-sex conspecific or predator. We tested hypotheses about
   the space use of meadow voles, Microtus pennsylvanicus, in an arena
   containing a short arm and a long arm that both lead to the bedding of a
   sexually receptive opposite-sex conspecific. Subjects were tested under
   three conditions: in an empty arena (experiment 1); in an arena
   containing the scent mark of a known predator, the mink. Mustela vison
   (experiment 2); in an arena containing the scent mark of a same-sex
   conspecific (experiment 3). Male voles placed into an empty arena
   preferred to take the shorter of two paths to reach the bedding of a
   sexually receptive female; females did not show a preference in the
   length of the path to reach the bedding of a sexually receptive male.
   Male and females showed no preference for the short or the long path to
   reach the bedding of a potential mate, independent of the placement of
   the scent mark of a mink in the long or short path. Females and males
   showed no preference for the short or the long path to reach the bedding
   of a potential mate, independent of the placement of the scent mark of a
   same-sex conspecific in the long or short path. Males however, were less
   likely than females to enter a path if it contained the scent mark of a
   same-sex conspecific. The paths that male and female voles take to reach
   an opposite-sex conspecifics may be associated with sex differences
   their responses to risks of predation and same-sex competition.

AB Many mammal species can distinguish between opposite-sex conspecifics
   that differ in a certain trait. In that coat coloration is associated
   with differences in physiological and behavioral traits, coat color may
   affect the attractiveness of odor cues produced by conspecifics.
   Individuals may be able to respond preferentially to conspecifics with a
   particular coat color. In the present study, we test the hypothesis that
   scent marks of brown and blond voles differ in their attractiveness to
   male and female conspecifics. Male voles and brown females did not
   discriminate between blond- and brown-coated opposite-sex conspecifics
   suggesting that they are neither selecting potential mates
   dissociatively nor associatively. However, blond females behaved as if
   the scent marks of blond males were more attractive than were the scent
   marks of brown males. Our data suggest that blond females who are
   already conspicuous to predators, may select blond males as mates
   because they do not appreciably increase the risk of detection to
   predators, particularly avian predators. Moreover, because these
   conspicuous males have survived to mate they may have good genes that
   reflect their relatively higher quality [Current Zoology 58 (2):
   221-227, 2012].

AB Mammals have the ability to identify particular conspecifics and in
   doing so use this information to discriminate between them, and respond
   in a manner that increases their survival and fitness. This narrative
   focuses on the behavioral challenges that voles face when they have to
   make decisions about mate choice, same-sex competition, odor
   communication, and sperm allocation. The narrative points out the
   different decisions that voles may make when they encounter the social
   information contained in the scent marks and over-marks of different
   conspecifics. The narrative demonstrates that the choices made by voles,
   and their resulting behaviors, may depend on several factors including
   the vole's own condition, age, and sex and those of nearby same- and
   opposite-sex conspecifics. The results of these studies are ecologically
   relevant as they reflect situations and challenges faced by free-living
   voles. The range of situations that voles find themselves and the
   decisions voles make when they encounter a potential mate or competitor
   become the backdrop of the narrative. Concentrating on the responses of
   a single model species was intentional. This approach may allow specific
   comparisons with other terrestrial mammals, facing similar behavioral
   and ecological challenges.

AB The response to signals, including scent marks, from opposite-sex
   conspecifics can be affected by the nutritional state of both the sender
   and receiver of these signals. Protein content of the diet affects how
   meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus) respond to single scent marks,
   but it is unknown how it affects an individual's response to the
   overlapping scent marks of two donors (an over-mark). In experiment 1,
   we tested the hypothesis that protein content of the diet affects the
   amount of time voles spend investigating the marks of the top- and
   bottom-scent donors of an over-mark. Males and females fed a 22% protein
   diet spent more time investigating the scent mark of the top-scent donor
   than that of the bottom-scent donor; voles fed 9% and 13% protein diets
   spent similar amounts of time investigating the top- and bottom-scent
   donors. In experiment 2, we tested the hypothesis that protein content
   of the diet of the top- and bottom-scent donors affects the amount of
   time conspecifics spend investigating their scent marks. Female voles
   spent more time investigating the mark of the top-scent male than that
   of the bottom-scent male, independent of the differences in protein
   content of the diets of the top- and bottom-scent donors. Male voles,
   however, spent more time investigating the top-scent female when she was
   fed a diet higher in protein content than that of the bottom-scent
   female. Our results are discussed within the context of the natural
   history of voles.

AB Seasonally breeding animals oftentimes alter their social interactions
   as a result of the shift from a long-day to short-day photoperiod. When
   this occurs, behaviours and corresponding affiliations with conspecifics
   will change as well. Consequently, individuals may react differently
   towards signals made by conspecifics as a result of this seasonal shift.
   We examined the responses of short photoperiod (SP) male and female
   meadow voles to the over-marks of two opposite-sex conspecifics that
   were born and raised in the same or in a different photoperiod. We
   tested the hypothesis that seasonal differences exist in the responses
   of voles to the top- and bottom-scent donors of a same-sex over-mark. We
   predicted that SP voles would not spend more time investigating the mark
   of the top-scent donor than that of bottom-scent donor of an over-mark;
   a response that is different from that of long photoperiod (LP) meadow
   voles to the mark of the top- and bottom-scent donors of an over-mark.
   After exposure to various over-mark treatments, SP male subjects later
   spent more time investigating the mark of the SP female that provided
   the top-scent mark to that of the SP female that provided the
   bottom-scent mark and more time investigating the mark of the top-scent
   LP female than that of bottom-scent SP female, but they spent similar
   amounts of time investigating the mark of the top-scent SP female and
   that of the bottom-scent SP female. In contrast, SP females spent
   similar amounts of time investigating the mark of the top-scent LP male
   and that of the bottom-scent SP male, the mark of the top-scent SP male
   and that of the bottom-scent LP male, and the mark of the top-scent LP
   male and that of the bottom-scent LP male. The data provide mixed
   support for the hypothesis, indicating that sex differences exist in the
   response of SP meadow voles to the marks of the top- and bottom-scent
   donors of an over-mark. This suggests that the responses of voles to
   over-marks of donors from the same photoperiods vary seasonally for
   females but not for males. The sex differences in the response of voles
   to over-marks may depend on their reproductive state as well as the
   reproductive state of the donors and the position of the donor's scent
   marks in the over-mark.

AB How an individual responds to scent marks and the information they
   receive from them may be affected by whether the scent marks are
   encountered singly or as part of an over-mark, two overlapping scent
   marks. We tested the hypothesis that meadow voles that have encountered
   an area containing over-marks and single scent marks from two
   conspecifics respond preferentially to the donor that was last to
   deposit its scent marks compared to the donor that was first to deposit
   its scent marks. Males spent more time investigating the mark of the
   second female-scent donor than that of the first female-scent donor
   after they encountered 60% over-marks and 40% single scent marks from
   these donors. Females spent more time investigating the scent mark of
   the second male-scent donor than that of the first male-scent donor
   after they encountered at least 40% over-marks and 60% single marks.
   Interestingly, the proportions of over-marks that male and female voles
   needed to encounter to display a preference for the mark of the second
   scent donor over that of the second scent donor were similar to the
   proportion of scent marks males and females use to over-mark the scent
   marks of a same-sex conspecific.

AB Male mammals are attracted to the scent marks of sexually receptive
   female conspecifics. Male voles spend more time investigating the scent
   marks of female voles in postpartum oestrus (PPE), a heightened state of
   sexual receptivity that occurs following the delivery of a litter,
   compared to those of female voles that are not in PPE, but in a moderate
   state of sexual receptivity. However, both types of females will attract
   male conspecifics to deposit their scent marks near those deposited by
   these females. The scent marks deposited by these males may indicate how
   many males have visited this female, which may affect how attractive she
   is to other males. In the present study, we exposed male meadow voles,
   Microtus pennsylvanicus, to the scent mark of a PPE female and a female
   that was not in PPE, a reference female (REF female); the scent marks of
   0, 1 or 5 males were placed adjacent to the scent marks of these two
   female scent donors. In doing so, we tested three hypotheses. The first
   hypothesis is males will spend less time investigating the scent mark of
   a female that has more scent marks of male conspecifics adjacent to it
   compared to that of a female that has fewer scent marks of male
   conspecifics adjacent to it. The second hypothesis is the converse of
   the first hypothesis. The third hypothesis is males will spend more time
   investigating the scent mark of a PPE female than that of a REF female,
   independent of the number of scent marks of other males adjacent to
   them. Overall, our data suggests that a combination of factors may
   influence a male's preference for the scent marks of potential mates.
   Most tests suggest that males will respond preferentially to a female if
   she has more male suitors than another female, independent of the
   reproductive state of either female. If however, the number of male
   suitors is the same for each female, males tend to prefer the scent mark
   of the female that is in a more heightened state of sexual receptivity.

AB Differences in the protein content of individuals may affect their
   response to signals produced by opposite-sex conspecifics and how
   opposite-sex conspecifics respond to the individual's own signals. Many
   terrestrial mammals use over-marks to communicate with potential mates.
   In this study, we determined whether over-marking behavior is affected
   by the protein content of the top-and bottom-scent donors of an
   over-mark. We tested two hypotheses by performing two experiments on
   meadow voles, Microtus pennsylvanicus, in which the top-or bottomscent
   donors of an over-mark were fed a diet containing either 9, 13, or 22%
   protein; these protein concentrations are similar to those that voles
   may consume in free-living populations. In experiment 1, we varied the
   protein content of the top-scent voles but not that of the bottom-scent
   donor. We tested the hypothesis that top-scent donor voles fed a diet
   high in protein content deposit more scent marks and more over-marks
   than do top-scent donor voles fed diets lower in protein content. In
   experiment 2, the top-scent voles were fed a 22% protein diet but the
   protein content of the diet of the bottom-scent donor varied. We tested
   the hypothesis that the top-scent donor will deposit more scent marks if
   the bottom-scent vole was fed a diet high in protein content than if it
   was fed a diet lower in protein content. Protein content of the
   top-scent vole's diet did not affect the number of scent marks and
   over-marks it deposited. Likewise, the protein content of the
   bottom-scent vole did not affect the number of scent marks and
   over-marks deposited by the top-scent vole.

AB The behaviors that surround copulation are characterized as sociosexual
   behaviors. These behaviors displayed by males that are directed at
   females may include allogrooming, wrestling, chasing, approach, and time
   spent together. The data supported the hypothesis that the duration of
   sociosexual behaviors differs during the pre-copulatory,
   peri-copulatory, and post-copulatory phases of the mating bout in meadow
   voles. Voles spent more time approaching conspecifics during the pre-
   and peri-copulatory phases than during the post-copulatory phase. Voles
   spent more time allogrooming, wrestling, and chasing during the pre-
   copulatory phase than during the peri- and post-copulatory phases. Voles
   spent similar amounts of time together during the pre-, peri-, and
   post-copulatory phases. The data suggest that sociosexual behaviors
   displayed by males may be involved in setting the pace and temporal
   components of the mating bout. During the pre- copulatory phase
   particular behaviors by male voles may attract females, during the peri-
   copulatory phase some of these behaviors may stimulate or motivate the
   female to mate, and during the post-copulatory phase certain behaviors
   may prepare the male to mate again [Current Zoology 57 (1): 43-49,

AB Previous studies have shown that individuals responded preferentially to

   encounter over-marks consisting of the scent marks of more than two
   same-sex conspecifics in the intersections of runways, near the nests of
   sexually receptive female conspecifics, and inside and along the borders
   of the territories of conspecifics. We determined how meadow voles,
   Microtus pennsylvanicus, respond to the marks of the top-, middle-, and
   bottom-scent donors of an over-mark. We tested the hypothesis that voles
   exposed to an over-mark will respond preferentially to the scent marks
   that were deposited more recently, the scent marks that were on top or
   near the top of the over-mark, compared to the scent marks that were
   deposited earlier or near the bottom of the over-mark. Voles spent more
   time investigating the mark of the top-scent donor than that of the
   either the middle-or bottom-scent donor. However, males but not female
   voles spent more time investigating the middle-scent mark than the
   bottom-scent mark. We also tested the hypothesis that voles evaluate and
   respond to over-marks differently from single scent marks. Voles spent
   more time investigating the marks of the top-, middle-, and bottom-scent
   donors compared to scent marks that were not part of the over-mark.
   Voles can distinguish among the overlapping scent marks of three scent
   donors and sex differences exist in the values they appear to attach to
   each of these scent marks [Current Zoology 57 (4): 441-448, 2011].

AB Voles use runways, paths, and trails that may also be used by rabbits
   and mink. These shared areas could contain the scent marks of
   conspecifics and heterospecifics. Thus, it is likely that the scent
   marks of heterospecifics may overlap or be overlapped by those of voles,
   forming over-marks. Much is known about how voles respond to over-marks
   of two different conspecifics. However, we do not know how they would
   respond to an opposite-sex conspecific whose scent marks are in an
   over-mark with the scent marks of predator or the scent marks of a
   non-predator heterospecifics. We tested the hypothesis that meadow
   voles, Microtus pennsylvanicus, differ in their response to the scent
   mark of the opposite-sex conspecific if the scent mark was overlapped by
   that of a mink, a vole predator, or rabbit, a vole non-predator. We
   found that female but not male voles showed a preference for the scent
   marks of the opposite-sex conspecifics that were part of the mink-vole
   over-mark when compared to those of opposite-sex conspecifics that were
   not part of the over-mark. This preference by female voles was
   independent of whether the male vole was the top-scent donor or
   bottom-scent donor of the over-mark. Male and female voles showed no
   preference between the scent marks of the opposite-sex conspecifics
   whose marks were part of or not part of the rabbit-vole over-mark. Sex
   differences in the manner that meadow voles respond to rabbit-vole and

AB Scent marking and over-marking are important forms of communication
   between the sexes for many terrestrial mammals. Over the course of three
   experiments, we determined whether the amount of time individuals
   investigate the scent marks of opposite-sex conspecifics is affected by
   4 d of olfactory experience with those conspecifics. In Experiment 1,
   female meadow voles, Microtus pennsylvanicus, spent more time
   investigating the scent mark of the novel male conspecific than that of
   the familiar male donor, whereas male voles spent similar amounts of
   time investigating the scent mark of the familiar female and a novel
   female conspecific. In Experiment 2, voles were exposed to a mixed-sex
   over-mark in which subjects did not have 4 d of olfactory experience
   with either the top-scent donor or the bottom-scent donor. During the
   test phase, male and female voles spent more time investigating the
   scent mark of the opposite-sex conspecific that provided the top-scent
   mark than that of a novel, opposite-sex conspecific. Male and female
   voles spent similar amounts of time investigating the scent mark of the
   bottom-scent donor and that of a novel opposite-sex conspecific. In
   Experiment 3, voles were exposed to a mixed-sex over-mark that contained
   the scent mark of an opposite-sex conspecific with which they had 4 d of
   olfactory experience. During the test phase, male voles spent more time
   investigating the mark of the familiar, top-scent female than the scent
   mark of a novel female donor but spent similar amounts of time
   investigating the mark of the familiar, bottom-scent female and that of
   a novel female donor. In contrast, female voles spent more time
   investigating the mark of a novel male donor than that of either the
   familiar, top-scent male or that of the familiar, bottom-scent male. The
   sex differences in the responses of voles to scent marks and mixed-sex

AB Meadow voles, Microtus pennsylvanicus, self-groom before, during and
   after copulation, which may convey olfactory information to nearby
   conspecifics. Since males who self-groom at high rates were found to be
   attractive to females, it is possible that the copulating male may
   attempt to increase his attractiveness over that of other males who are
   present or nearby. In that the presence of other males affects sperm
   investment and can be used by males as an indicator of sperm
   competition, we tested the hypothesis that the presence of scent marks
   of other males near a sexually receptive female affects the
   self-grooming behaviour of males that encounter them. We did so by
   pairing a male and a female vole in the presence of the odours of one
   male conspecific, five male conspecifics, or no male conspecifics. The
   amount of time male voles self-groomed was not affected by the risk or
   intensity of sperm competition. We also tested the hypothesis that
   self-grooming behaviour of males differed depending on whether it was
   performed before, during, or after copulation. Male voles differed in
   the amount of time and the location on their body that they self-groomed
   before, during, and after copulation.

AB Models of age-related effects on behavior predict that among short-lived
   species younger adults are more attractive and attracted to opposite-sex
   conspecifics than are older adults, whereas the converse is predicted
   for long-lived species. Although most studies of age-related effects on
   behavior support these predictions, they are not supported by many
   studies of scent marking, a behavior used in mate attraction.
   Over-marking, a form of scent marking, is a tactic used by many
   terrestrial mammals to convey information about themselves to
   opposite-sex conspecifics. The present study tested the hypothesis that
   the age of meadow voles, Microtus pennsylvanicus; a microtine rodent,
   affects their over- and scent-marking behaviors when they encounter the
   marks of opposite-sex conspecifics. Sex differences existed in the
   over-marking behavior of adult voles among the three different age
   groups that were tested. Male voles that were 5-7 and 10-12 mo olds
   over-marked a higher proportion of the marks of females than did 2-3 mo
   old male voles. Female voles that were 2-3, 5-7, and 10-12 mo old
   over-marked a similar number of marks deposited by male voles. Overall,
   the data were not consistent with models predicting the behavior of
   short-lived animals such as rodents when they encounter the opposite
   sex. The differences in over-marking displayed by older and younger
   adult male voles may be associated with life history tradeoffs, the
   likelihood that they will encounter sexually receptive females, and
   being selected as mates.

AB Animals in a variety of taxa discriminate between a greater quantity and
   a lesser quantity of the same object, an ability that is referred to as
   relative numerousness judgment. For example, meadow voles can
   distinguish between areas containing more over-marks by one opposite-sex
   scent donor and fewer over-marks by another opposite-sex scent donor.
   Females appear to be able to make better discriminations between more or
   less over-marks than do males. In that gonadal hormones have been
   implicated in modulating cognitive function associated with spatial
   tasks, we tested the hypothesis that high titers of testosterone and
   estradiol are necessary for male and female voles, respectively, to
   distinguish between the top- and bottom-scent donors in an area
   containing mixed over-marks. We gonadectomized voles, giving them either
   gonadal hormone replacement (testosterone for males and estradiol for
   females) or no hormone replacement, and tested their spontaneous
   judgments of distinguishing between the top- and bottom-scent donors in
   an area containing mixed over-marks; a task involving judgments of
   relative numerousness. Female voles given replacement estradiol
   performed better than did female voles not given replacement estradiol
   in determining the top-scent and bottom-scent males in areas containing
   mixed over-marks. In contrast, males not treated with replacement
   testosterone performed better than did males treated with testosterone
   in determining the top-scent and bottom-scent males in areas containing
   mixed over-marks. Thus, high titers of estradiol and low titers of
   testosterone are associated with better performance on tasks involving
   relative numerousness in female and male voles, respectively. The
   results of this task on relative numerousness judgments are discussed in
   relation to the effects of gonadal steroid hormone on spatial ability, a
   closely related cognitive domain, and the social biology of meadow
   voles. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Many animals self-groom when they encounter the scent marks of
   opposite-sex conspecifics. Self-grooming transmits odiferous substances
   that contain information about the groomer's condition, which is
   affected by its nutritional state. We tested the hypothesis that the
   amount of time that individuals self-groom to opposite-sex conspecifics
   is affected by the amount of protein in their diet and that of the scent
   donor. We did so by feeding meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus) a
   diet containing 9%, 13%, or 22% dietary protein for 30 d and observing
   their self-grooming behavior when they were exposed to bedding scented
   by an opposite-sex conspecific (odor donor) fed one of the three diets,
   or fresh cotton bedding (control). The hypothesis was partially
   supported. We found that the protein content of the diet of male and
   female groomers did not affect the amount of time they self-groomed.
   However, the protein content of the diet of male odor donors affected
   the amount of time that female voles spent self-grooming. Female voles
   self-groomed more in response to male odor donors fed a 22%
   protein-content diet than to those produced by male odor donors fed
   either a 9% or a 13% protein-content diet. Interestingly, the amount of
   time males self-groomed was not affected by the protein content of the
   diet of the female odor donor. These results may, in part, be explained
   by the natural history of free-living meadow voles, sex differences in
   costs associated with mate attraction and reproduction, and the direct
   or indirect benefits that females receive from males fed a diet high in
   protein content.

AB Sperm competition occurs when 2 or more males copulate with a particular
   female during the same reproductive cycle, and their sperm compete to
   fertilize the female's available eggs. One strategy that male voles use
   to assess the risk and intensity of sperm competition involves
   responding to the presence of scent marks of conspecific males found
   near a sexually receptive female. Previously, we have shown that if a
   male vole copulated with a female while he was in the presence of the
   odors of another male he increased his sperm investment relative to his
   investment if another male's odors were not present. The aim of the
   present study was to test the hypothesis that males assess differences
   in the relative quality of competing males and adjust their sperm
   investment accordingly. We did so by allowing males to copulate when
   they were exposed to the scent mark of a 24-h food-deprived male
   (low-quality male) or the scent mark of a male that was not food
   deprived (high-quality male). The data indicate that male meadow voles
   did not increase their sperm investment during copulation when exposed
   to the scent mark of a food-deprived male but did so when they were
   exposed to the scent mark of a male that was not food deprived. The
   results support the hypothesis that male voles are able to adjust sperm
   investment when they encounter the scent marks of males that differ in
   quality.

AB Particular features of the signaling characteristics of the scent marks
   of temperate zone, seasonally breeding mammals may reflect differences
   in their reproductive state and, hence, be variable. Consequently, an
   individual's perception of self may depend more on the condition
   independent than on the condition-dependent signaling characteristics of
   the scent marks. Yet, we do not know whether an individual responds to
   changes in the signaling characteristics of its own scent marks, such as
   those associated with changes in an individual's reproductive state.
   Such changes may affect how and where an animal scent marks. Here we
   report on a series of experiments designed to test the hypothesis that
   individual meadow voles, Microtus pennsylvanicus, distinguish between
   scent marks they deposited when they were in different reproductive
   states. Results showed that voles discriminated their own scent marks
   from those of unfamiliar, same-sex conspecifics, and the scent marks of
   siblings. Voles did not behave as if they could distinguish between
   their own scent marks if the marks were deposited when the voles were in
   the same reproductive state, although the two scent marks used as
   stimuli differed in age by 30 d. However, they did so distinguish if
   they were exposed to scent marks taken when they were in different
   reproductive states. Overall, these findings suggest that voles behave
   as if their novel and familiar scent marks shared the similar signaling
   features. If, however, the reproductive condition of the voles differed
   when it provided the two scent marks, they behaved as if their own scent
   marks had different signal characteristics, which may have induced voles
   to treat the two scent marks as not being the same or having been
   deposited by two different donors. We speculate that the scent marks of
   individuals may have unique signaling characteristics that may be
   associated with that individual's 'current template for self'.

AB Sexually reproducing organisms must process and respond to internal and
   external stimuli to successfully synchronize physiological and
   behavioural processes involved in reproduction. One such cue is an
   individual's social environment. Interactions with conspecifics affect a
   female's reproductive activity by inducing, suppressing, and/or
   accelerating reproductive processes. For example, many studies support
   the theory that the presence of a same-sex conspecific may suppress an
   animal's reproductive physiology, whereas an opposite-sex conspecific
   may stimulate an animal's reproductive physiology. The present study
   determined whether exposure to a conspecific male or female affects the
   onset of follicular development in sexually-experienced female leopard
   geckos (Eublepharis macularius). The data show that follicular growth
   was not affected by whether female geckos were housed next to a male
   conspecific, a female conspecific, or isolated from conspecifics. In
   addition, the number of days until the initiation of follicular
   development of female geckos was not affected by whether the females
   were housed in the presence of a conspecific or in isolation. The
   results are discussed within the theoretical framework of the effects of
   social cues on the reproductive physiology of females and the limited
   empirical data about such effects in squamate lizards.

AB Females across many taxa may mate with several males or mate more than
   once with the same male within one reproductive event. Although many
   researchers have discussed the effects of multiple mating on
   reproductive success of females, few studies have attempted to
   disentangle whether the reproductive success of females differs with
   respect to whether females mate with multiple males or mate more than
   once with one male. In this study, we hypothesized that female leopard
   geckos (Eublepharis macularius) increase aspects of their reproductive
   success, such as fecundity, fertility and relative clutch mass, by
   mating more than once within one reproductive event, either by mating
   repeatedly with the same male or multiply mating with different males.
   We controlled for the potentially confounding variables of mating
   frequency and mate number by allowing females to mate once with one
   male, twice with the same male, or twice with two different males. We
   found that females that mated with more than one male laid more
   clutches, exhibited increased egg fertility and invested more in
   clutches relative to females that mated only once with one male, whereas
   females that mated twice to the same male were intermediate for these
   variables. Thus, reproductive success is higher among female leopard
   geckos that mated with more than one male compared to female leopard
   geckos that mated only once.

AB Previous research has reported skeletal muscle protein expression

   sexual dimorphism characteristics of skeletal muscle for other rodents
   such as voles, for which the behavior, morphology, and physiology have
   been documented. Myosin heavy chain (MHC) content in skeletal muscle is
   related to functional characteristics. This study investigated sex
   characteristics (male, n = 6; female, n = 8) for MHC expression for
   triceps brachii, tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius, and soleus muscles in
   prairie voles. Relative (%) MHC protein expression was determined via
   SDS-PAGE for types I, II a, II d/x, and II b MHC isoforms. Male voles
   had greater soleus wet weight and greater II a MHC expression for
   tibialis anterior as compared to those of female voles. Skeletal muscle
   mass and MHC protein expression were not sexually dimorphic. Differences
   in circulating testosterone titers did not appear to influence these
   characteristics of mature peripheral skeletal muscle. Prairie voles,
   however, exhibited much more heterogeneity in MHC expression as compared
   to previous reports on rats, rabbits, and mice. It is likely that this
   is due to differences in the natural history and functional requirements
   of voles and other small mammals [ Acta Zoologica Sinica 54 (1): 104 -

AB Some non-human animals may possess the ability to recall the "what",

   that male meadow voles posses the capacity to recall the "what",
   "where", and "when" of a single past event associated with mate
   selection in two experiments. Briefly, male voles were allowed to
   explore an apparatus that contained two chambers. One chamber contained
   a day-20 pregnant female (24 h prepartum). The other chamber contained a
   sexually mature female that was neither pregnant nor lactating (REF
   female). Twenty-four hour after the exposure, the males were placed in
   the same apparatus, which was empty and clean. At this time, the
   pregnant female would have entered postpartum estrus (PPE), a period of
   heightened sexual receptivity. Males initially chose and spent
   significantly more time investigating the chamber that originally housed
   the pregnant female (now a PPE female) than the chamber that originally
   housed the REF female. Male voles also explored an apparatus containing
   a chamber with a PPE female and one chamber containing a REF female.
   Twenty-four hour later, males were placed into an empty and clean
   apparatus. The males did not display an initial choice and they spent
   similar amounts of time investigating the chamber that originally housed
   the PPE female (now a lactating female) and the chamber that originally
   housed the REF female. The results of these and additional experiments
   suggest that male voles may have the capacity to recall the "what",
   "where", and "when" of a single past event, which may allow males to
   remember the location of females who would currently be in heightened
   states of sexual receptivity.

AB Many terrestrial mammals, including voles, self-groom when they
   encounter odors of opposite-sex conspecifics. Voles also spend different
   amounts of time self-grooming when they are exposed to odors of
   reproductively active and reproductively quiescent opposite-sex
   conspecifics, suggesting that self-grooming may be involved in the
   behaviors that support reproduction. If self-grooming is affected by the
   reproductive condition of the donor and the groomer, it is also likely
   that their ages will influence the amount of time that the groomer will
   self-groom. The objective of this paper was to test the hypothesis that
   age of the groomer and the scent donor affects the amount of time that
   meadow voles, Microtus pennsylvanicus, spend self-grooming when exposed
   to bedding scented by opposite-sex conspecifics. Older males (12-13
   mo-old) spent more time self-grooming than younger males did (2-3 mo-old
   and 8-9 mo-old) when they were exposed to odors of 2-3 mo-old and 8-9
   mo-old female voles. Younger males spent similar amounts of time
   self-grooming in response to odors of 2-3 mo-old, 8-9 mo-old, and 12-13
   mo-old female voles. Female voles, independent of their age, spent more
   time self-grooming in response to odors of 12-13 mo-old males relative
   to 2-3 mo-old and 8-9 mo-old males. These data demonstrate that voles
   discriminate between the odors of different age opposite-sex
   conspecifics and adjust the amount of time they self-groom when exposed
   to them. The data augment the view that self-grooming is a specialized
   form of olfactory communication between the sexes.

AB The effects of winning and losing on over-marking behaviour of mammals,

   marks they use to over-mark the marks of same-sex conspecifics. Female
   meadow voles that won their encounter used a higher proportion of their
   marks to over-mark the marks of female conspecifics than did females
   that either lost their encounter, were evenly matched, unfamiliar, or

AB Sperm competition occurs when the sperm of two or more males compete to
   fertilize the egg/s of a particular female. Males of some species
   respond to a high risk of sperm competition by increasing the number of
   sperm in their ejaculates. Males may accomplish such a response by
   increasing the intensity or duration of contraction of the cauda
   epididymidis and vas deferens. During emission (first phase of the
   ejaculatory process), the vas deferens receives sperm from the cauda
   epididymidis and propels the sperm to the urethra. In this paper, we
   tested the hypothesis that males exposed to a high risk of sperm
   competition mobilize larger numbers of sperm from the cauda epididymidis
   to the vas deferens before initiation of copulatory behavior. This
   accumulation of sperm in the vas deferens would result in a larger
   number of sperm in the ejaculate. To test this hypothesis, we exposed
   male meadow voles, Microtus pennsylvanicus, to either low or high risks
   of sperm competition using soiled bedding of conspecific individuals. At
   three different times after this exposure (15, 30, or 60 min), we
   removed both vasa deferentia and counted the sperm within them. We found
   a significant increase in sperm numbers in the vas deferens of males
   after 30 min of being exposed to a high risk of sperm competition. The
   lower sperm numbers after 15 and 60 min of exposure suggest that the
   observed response is relatively slow and that sperm mobilized to the
   vasa deferentia may return to the cauda epididymides if ejaculation does
   not occur some time after the observed response. Our results indicate
   that the physiological response that may result in high sperm numbers in
   the ejaculate in relation to high risk of sperm competition can occur
   before initiation of copulatory behavior.

AB For meadow voles, Microtus pennsylvanicus, seasonal differences exist in
   self-grooming and in odor preferences for conspecifics, two behaviors
   which facilitate sexual interactions in this species. Both behaviors are
   mediated by photoperiodically-induced changes in circulating gonadal
   steroid hormone titers which, in turn, can be transduced by the duration
   of the melatonin signal that a seasonally breeding animal receives. The
   goal of this study was to determine whether exogenous melatonin
   administration affects circulating gonadal steroid hormone titers in
   meadow voles, and whether it influences their odor preferences and
   self-grooming behavior to same- and opposite-sex conspecifics.
   Long-photoperiod voles that did not receive exogenous melatonin had
   higher testosterone (males) and estradiol (females) titers than did
   short-photoperiod votes and long-photoperiod voles treated with
   melatonin for 12 weeks; the latter had similar estradiol and
   testosterone titers. Long-photoperiod voles that did not receive
   melatonin preferred the scent marks of long-photoperiod opposite-sex
   conspecifics and spent more time self-grooming in response to their
   odors than those of either long-photoperiod same-sex, short-photoperiod
   same-sex, or short-photoperiod opposite-sex conspecifics.
   Long-photoperiod voles that received melatonin, however, no longer
   preferred the marks of long-photoperiod opposite-sex conspecifics and no
   longer spent more time self-grooming in response to their odors, not
   unlike the odor preferences and self-grooming behavior of
   short-photoperiod voles. As a whole, the data suggest that the duration
   of the melatonin signal is likely involved in mediating the
   photoperiodically-induced changes in gonadal steroid hormones that
   mediate a meadow vole's odor preferences for opposite-sex conspecifics
   and its self-grooming response to those marks. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

AB Females in numerous taxa engage in mating with more than one male within
   a breeding season, usually to gain direct or indirect benefits from
   their male partners. Although effort has been directed towards the
   benefits females derive from multiple mating, we have less information
   as to decisions females make when choosing to mate with more than one
   male and if her decision is contingent upon previous mating experience
   with a male. In some instances, females must decide whether or not to
   mate with a previous mate or a novel male, the outcome of which would
   have ramifications on the acquisition of direct and indirect benefits.
   In this study, we tested whether female leopard geckos, Eublepharis
   macularius, would forgo mating with a previous mate partner in favor of
   a novel male. We found no difference in a female's willingness to
   copulate with a previous mate versus a novel male. However, we found
   that smaller females initiated copulation termination with a previous
   mate whereas larger females allowed males to terminate copulations. This
   pattern was not exhibited when smaller females were paired with novel
   partners. Thus, smaller females appear to discriminate between previous
   mates and novel males, favoring novel males as mates.

AB In many small mammalian species, females undergo postpartum estrus
   (PPE), mate, and become pregnant soon after delivering a litter. Mating
   during PPE implies a trade-off between attending to the new litter and
   leaving that litter to mate. We tested the hypothesis that copulatory
   behavior is faster when a female mates during PPE than when it mates
   outside of PPE, during male-induced estrus (MIE), a time when it is not
   lactating. We compared several variables of copulatory behavior in
   female meadow vole mating during both PPE and MIE. Females in PPE
   received significantly fewer intromissions, with shorter intervals
   between intromissions. Each ejaculatory series was also shorter for
   females in PPE. As a consequence, the total amount of time devoted to
   copulation was much shorter for females in PPE than for those in MIE.
   These data support the hypothesis that female meadow voles are able to
   reduce their copulatory behavior during PPE.

AB Food availability affects whether mammals communicate their interest in
   interacting with opposite-sex conspecifics. This study examined the
   responses of voles to over-marks, and factors that influence the
   formation and maintenance of a preference for the top-scent in an
   over-mark. Specifically, we investigated how food deprivation affected
   the amount of time male and female voles exposed to an over-mark, later
   responded to the marks of the top- and bottom-scent donors when
   subsequently presented with the two scents side by side. Males and
   females that were not food deprived and males that were food deprived 6
   h before exposure to an over-mark later maintained a preference for the
   donor of the top-scent mark compared with the donor of the bottom-scent
   mark of the over-mark. Females that were food deprived for 6 h before or
   after exposure of the over-mark and males food deprived 6 h after the
   exposure to the over-mark showed no preference for the top-scent mark
   donor. Re-feeding females that were food deprived for 6 h before
   exposure to an over-mark was sufficient to restore their preference for
   the mark of the top-scent male over that of the bottom-scent male. The
   different responses of food-deprived male and female voles to over-marks
   of opposite-sex conspecifics may be associated with differences in their
   tactics for interacting with potential mates and the higher energetic
   costs of reproduction in female voles than in male voles.

AB What we refer to as over-marking occurs when one individual places its
   scent mark on top of, touching, or adjacent to the scent mark of another
   individual, usually a conspecific. Over-marking frequently occurs among
   mammals that share common paths, trails, and runways. Despite its
   ubiquity among terrestrial mammals, we know little about how individuals
   respond to over-marks and the function(s) of over-marking. Studies on
   voles and golden hamsters indicate that after exploring an over-mark,
   individuals respond selectively to the mark of the top-scent donor
   relative to that of the bottom-scent donor. Thus, individuals may be
   able to focus their attention on a particular scent mark relevant at a
   particular time and in a particular context, neglecting other scent
   marks that are present. The function(s) of over-marking are examined
   within the framework of ten hypotheses. Several hypotheses are
   plausible. However, the bulk of the literature is consistent with
   hypotheses stating that over-marking serving a role in olfactory
   communication between opposite and same-sex conspecifics. Lastly, we
   postulate the costs and benefits that may be garnered by the top-scent
   donor of an over-mark.

AB It is not clear whether males in all mammalian species adjust their

   Previous work on meadow voles, Microtus pennsylvanicus, indicated that
   males increase their sperm expenditure but not the number of
   ejaculations in the presence of odors of a conspecific male. The present
   study follows up on this work and asks whether male meadow voles modify
   any aspect of their copulatory behavior when they face a RSC. We
   examined 46 variables of copulatory behavior and found that the presence
   of odors from a conspecific male did not affect any of these variables.
   Thus, male meadow voles, unlike some other species of mammals, do not
   adjust their copulatory behavior when exposed to cues associated with an
   elevated RSC.

AB Female mammals are particularly sensitive to changes in food
   availability. The mechanisms that affect sexual behavior and food intake
   are closely related to one another; chief among the mechanisms that
   control sexual behaviors in females is estradiol. In order to understand
   how food deprivation results in inhibition of sexual behavior
   (attractivity, proceptivity, and receptivity), we measured the effects
   of food deprivation on circulating concentrations of estradiol. We also
   determined whether estradiol treatment was sufficient to restore sexual
   behaviors in food-deprived female meadow voles. We found that estradiol
   titers of food-deprived female voles are significantly lower than those
   of ad lib-fed female voles. Further, we found that estradiol treatment
   was sufficient to restore proceptivity and receptivity in food-deprived,
   ovariectomized female voles. However, estradiol treatment was not able
   to overcome the food deprivation-induced inhibition of attractivity.
   Thus, decreases in estradiol titer of food-deprived female voles may be
   related to the suppression of their proceptive and receptive behaviors,
   and may be a mechanism that allows females to avoid mating when
   conditions are not propitious for their survival and that of their
   offspring. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

   Microtus pennsylvanicus. We found a negative correlation between
   percentage of external ejaculations experienced by males and the number
   of sperm allocated within the female reproductive tract. Thus, females
   may limit the fertilizing capacity of non-preferred males by causing
   them to ejaculate externally. The occurrence of external ejaculations
   was not affected by cues of other males, male body mass, female sexual
   experience, or male sexual experience. Our results expand the growing

AB Many hypotheses have been put forth to account for differences in the

   conspecifics or their odors, but most ignore the possibility that
   self-grooming may be associated with olfactory communication between
   groomers and conspecifics. As yet, we do not know the function of
   self-grooming and why animals do so when they encounter the odors of
   conspecifics. The present experiment tests the hypothesis that the
   amount of time that a meadow vole, Microtus pennsylvanicus, self-grooms
   is affected by the reproductive state of the odor donor and its own
   reproductive state. The findings support the hypothesis. Male votes
   spent more time self-grooming when they were exposed to bedding scented
   by female voles in postpartum estrus (PPE) compared to that of female
   voles in other reproductive states and female mice. PPE female voles
   spent more time self-grooming when they were exposed to bedding scented
   by testosterone-treated male voles than either to that of gonadectomized
   male voles and male mice. PPE female voles spent more time than OVX + E
   and more time than OVX females self-grooming when they were exposed to
   bedding scented by testosterone-treated male voles. GX + T male voles
   spent more time than GX male voles self-grooming when they were exposed
   to bedding scented by PPE female voles. The results suggest that
   individuals self-groom more in the presence of an odor of a highly
   receptive potential mate than that of a less receptive mate. (c) 2006

   discrimination between familiar and unfamiliar individuals can be
   extrapolated to include individual discrimination between two familiar
   individuals. The present study had two aims. First, we determined that
   male leopard geckos (Eublepharis macularius) can concurrently become
   familiar with two different females and discriminate those females from
   a novel female. Second, we investigated the ability of male leopard
   geckos to distinguish between two familiar females using a
   habituation-dishabituation paradigm. Males habituated to the presence of
   the first female, exhibited by decreased typical courtship behaviours
   directed towards that female. Male courtship behaviours, however, were
   reinstated upon introduction of the second familiar female. These
   results indicate that males possess the ability to discriminate between
   two familiar females and adjust their courtship efforts appropriately.

AB There are 2 models of male adjustment of sperm investment in the

   that as "risk" of sperm competition increases, sperm investment also
   increases. This prediction has been supported in many species, including
   mammals. The "intensity model" involves the number of competing males
   copulating with the same female and predicts that males will allocate
   the highest sperm investment at low sperm competition intensity (SCI)
   and then decreasing sperm investments as SCI increases. Two alternative
   outcomes are that sperm investment is unaffected by SCI and that sperm
   investment increases as SCI increases. There are studies supporting all
   3 possible outcomes in relation to SCI but no data on mammals. The
   present paper presents the first study of SCI in a mammal species, the
   meadow vole, Microtus pennsylvanicus. We used odors of conspecific males
   to simulate low and high intensities of sperm competition. We found that
   males allocate the highest sperm investment at low SCI and decrease
   significantly their sperm investment at high SCI. We also found that
   males allocate the lowest sperm investment at low sperm competition risk
   (SCR) and the highest sperm investment at high SCR. All these results
   agree with current theoretical models of sperm competition.

AB In many species of small mammals, females undergo post-partum oestrus
   soon after delivering a litter, becoming pregnant while suckling the
   previous litter. Females raising two concurrent litters need to allocate
   many more resources to reproduction than females raising only one
   litter. Consequently, there may be differences between litters raised
   concurrently or singly. We investigated this issue in the meadow vole,
   Microtus pennsylvanicus, a species in which most females in the wild
   reproduce during post-partum oestrus. Specifically, we tested the
   hypothesis that the development of pups in two concurrent litters
   differs from that of pups in a single litter. To test this hypothesis,
   we measured the following variables for concurrent and singly reared
   litters: gestation length; litter size; sex ratio; bodyweight of males
   and females at different ages; total litter weight at weaning; growth
   rates; and intra-litter variation in body mass. Except for bodyweight of
   males at 60 days of age, which was higher in the first of the concurrent
   litters, none of the variables differed among the litters. These results
   indicate that females are able to adjust to differing loads of maternal
   care to provide equivalent resources to concurrent litters and singly
   reared litters.

AB We determined whether seasonal differences exist in the amount of time
   meadow voles, Microtus pennsylvanicus, self-groom when they encounter
   the scents of conspecifics. To do so, we used voles that were born and
   reared under long photoperiod (LP) and short photoperiod (SP). LP voles
   represent those found in free-living populations during the spring and
   summer breeding season, whereas SP voles characterize those found in
   free-living populations during the fall and winter nonbreeding season.
   Experiment 1 showed that LP male and female voles self-groomed more in
   response to odors of LP opposite-sex conspecifics as compared to those
   of other LP and SP conspecifics, suggesting that they may be
   self-grooming to signal sexual interest or excitement to potential
   mates. Experiment 2 demonstrated that SP males self-groomed more in
   response to scents of LP female voles and those of SP males as compared
   to scents of LP males and SP females, whereas SP females spent similar
   amounts of time self-grooming in response to scents of LP males, LP
   females, SP females, and SP males. These seasonal differences in
   self-grooming may reflect differences in the messages produced by
   groomers when they broadcast their odors as well as differences in the
   meaning of such odors to opposite-sex conspecifics. Alternatively, these
   data may be associated with seasonal differences in sexual motivation of
   the groomers when exposed to scents of particular conspecifics.

AB Much research has been focused on the 'output' or response of males to
   particular risks of sperm competition (RSC). Lately, there has also been
   some interest on the types of information that males may use to assess
   RSC (RSC inputs). In contrast, there is a lack of studies on how males
   may process RSC inputs to generate such RSC outputs. Here we propose two
   modes of input Processing (direct and indirect) and ways to test them in
   order to understand how a male may process and store RSC information.
   The direct mode of input processing predicts that a male may store RSC
   inputs through a physiological response, c. g., through a change in
   hormonal levels. As long as this response is active, the male will stay
   in a 'RSC state' and will produce an RSC output (e. g., high sperm
   investment) instead of a non-RSC output (e.g., relatively lower sperm
   investment) when he encounters a female. The indirect mode of input
   processing predicts that a male may store RSC inputs in his memory and
   retrieve such information later on to modify his output (e.g., sperm
   investment or copulatory behavior) accordingly. We use a
   multidisciplinary approach that should appeal to those researchers that
   seek to understand male's adaptations to sperm competition at different
   levels. We believe that the testing of the hypotheses developed in this
   paper will lead to interesting findings and the development of new
   hypotheses.

AB Arguments swirl about explanations about the function of self-grooming
   in mammals. For instance, mammals self-groom to remove parasites that
   maybe transferred from a nearby opposite-sex conspecific during an
   encounter. Animals also self-groom when they encounter the odor of an
   opposite-sex conspecific because self-grooming is a re-directed behavior
   displayed by individuals that are torn between fleeing and fighting.
   Animals may self-groom to relieve stress and be a form of de-arousal. In
   other cases, animals may self-groom to indicate their response to
   conspecifics. The ubiquity of self-grooming in different contexts
   suggests that it serves multiple functions. Consequently, in this
   review, we do much to avoid arguments against these other roles for
   self-grooming. It is not our intent nor do we feel that it is
   constructive to label self-grooming as being solely a response to
   anxiety or stress, a mechanism to lower body temperature, or a behavior
   involved in care of the body surface. This limited view does not accept
   the possibility that self-grooming serves multiple domains. Rather, in
   this paper, we focus on a very specific context for self-grooming. That
   is, when an individual encounters the odors of a conspecific and
   self-grooms [Acta Zoologica Sinica 51 (5): 772-779, 2005].

   However, the majority of knowledge pertaining to

   behaviour of male and female meadow voles using a three-component model
   that included attractivity, proceptivity and receptivity. In both males
   and females, proceptivity and receptivity were inhibited by food
   deprivations that lasted 6 h. Attractivity in females was inhibited
   after 24 h of food deprivation, whereas attractivity of males did not
   appear to be affected at any duration of food deprivation tested. Both
   male and female proceptivity were attenuated by food deprivations of 6 h
   and longer. Finally, female receptivity was inhibited by food
   deprivations of 6 h or longer. The data support the metabolic fuels
   hypothesis in females and partially support the metabolic fuels
   hypothesis in males. Short-term (6-12 h) and moderate (18-24 h)
   interruptions in food availability had inhibitory effects on all

AB Self-grooming in response to the odors of conspecifics is a form of
   olfactory communication among meadow voles. The amount of time meadow
   voles spend self-grooming when they encounter the odors of conspecifics
   varies seasonally, with males targeting the odors of reproductively
   active females only during the breeding season. Other odor related
   behaviors in male voles such as odor preferences for conspecifics and
   the attractiveness of their odors to conspecifics vary seasonally as
   well. For male meadow voles, these behaviors are mediated by seasonal
   variations in testosterone (T) and prolactin (PRL) titers. The objective
   of this study was to determine whether seasonal differences in the
   amount of time male meadow voles self-groom in response to odors of
   conspecifics are mediated by seasonal rhythms in their circulating T and
   PRL titers. We tested the hypothesis that high titers of both T and PRL
   are necessary for reproductively active (long-photoperiod; LP) males and
   sufficient for reproductively quiescent (short-photoperiod; SP) male
   voles to spend more time self-grooming in response to odors of LP
   females than to those of other conspecifics. Results of this study
   demonstrate that high titers of PRL and T are necessary for LP male
   meadow vole to self-groom more in response to odors of LP females as
   compared to those of other conspecifics, but were not sufficient to
   induce SP males to preferentially self-groom to odors of LP females. The
   endocrine control of self-grooming by LP males appears to depend upon
   high titers of both PRL and T, which matches the endocrine mediation of
   other odor related behaviors in male voles. In contrast, the endocrine
   tissues that underlie self-grooming in SP male meadow voles appear to be
   refractory to the effects of LP-equivalent titers of PRL and T. (c) 2005

AB We provide a battery of screens that reflect the social and sexual
   behavior displayed by both captive and feral mice. Some screens focus on
   measuring aspects of chemical communication, providing information about
   whether or not mice will interact and if they do so, predict the nature
   of the interaction. Other screens measure direct interactions between
   target mice and same- and opposite-sex conspecifics, providing an
   indication of the social status and sexual responsiveness, respectively,
   of target mice. The battery of screens yields a high-throughput bioassay
   of a mouse's relative social status, competitive ability, social
   discrimination, and sexuality. These traits are essential elements of
   the socio-sexual behavior of mice as well as humans. Thus, by
   identifying phenotypic deviants for complex behaviors we will allow
   geneticists to map behavioral abnormalities onto specific chromosomes
   and increase the efficacy of genetically altered mice as models for
   human behavioral disorders. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Is it possible that voles have a sense of number? To address this
   question, we determined whether voles discriminate between two different
   scent-marking individuals and identify the individual whose scent marks
   was on top more often than the other individual. We tested whether voles
   show a preference for the individual whose scent marks was on top most
   often. If so, the simplest explanation was that voles can make a
   relative size judgement-such as distinguishing an area containing more
   of one individual's over-marks as compared to less of another
   individual's over-marks. We found that voles respond preferentially to
   the donor that provided a greater number of over-marks as compared to
   the donor that provided a lesser number of over-marks. Thus, we
   concluded that voles might display the capacity for relative
   numerousness. Interestingly, female voles were better able than male
   voles to distinguish between small differences in the relative number of
   over-marks by the two scent donors.

AB Food-deprived meadow voles were used to test predictions of two
   hypotheses associated with the recovery of sexual behaviors following
   re-feeding. Specifically, we tested between the body weight set point
   and metabolic fuels hypotheses. To do so, we determined whether the body
   weight of previously food-deprived female voles had to return to
   pre-food deprivation levels before they would recover their sexual
   behaviors. The body weight set point hypothesis predicts that
   food-deprived females that were re-fed will recover their sexual
   behavior after they return to their original body weight. In contrast,
   the metabolic fuels hypothesis predicts that food-deprived females that
   were re-fed will recover their sexual behavior before they return to
   their original body weight. That is, when the females are in positive
   energy balance. To distinguish between these two hypotheses, female
   voles were food deprived for 24 h, which is sufficient to inhibit all
   three components of sexual behavior. The food-deprived females were then
   supplied ad libitum food for 0 h, 24 It, 48 It, 72 h, or 96 h and
   weighed. Females were then tested for their sexual behaviors (odor
   attractivity, odor preference or proceptivity, sexual receptivity).
   Re-feeding for 48 It was sufficient to restore odor attractivity, 72 h
   was sufficient to restore odor preferences for opposite sex conspecific
   odors, and 96 h was sufficient to restore sexual receptivity to those
   similar to that of females that were not food deprived. The time-points
   that the behaviors were recovered were prior to voles recovering their
   initial body weight. Thus, the data support the metabolic fuels
   hypothesis. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Sperm competition occurs when a female copulates with two or more males
   and the sperm of those males compete within the female's reproductive
   tract to fertilize her eggs(1,2). The frequent occurrence of sperm
   competition has forced males of many species to develop different
   strategies to overcome the sperm of competing males(1,3). A prevalent
   strategy is for males to increase their sperm investment ( total number
   of sperm allocated by a male to a particular female) after detecting a
   risk of sperm competition(1,3,4). It has been shown that the proportion
   of sperm that one male contributes to the sperm pool of a female is
   correlated with the proportion of offspring sired by that male(5,6).
   Therefore, by increasing his sperm investment a male may bias a
   potential spermcompetition in his favour(5,7,8). Here we show that male
   meadow voles, Microtus pennsylvanicus, increase their sperm investment
   when they mate in the presence of another male's odours. Such an
   increase in sperm investment does not occur by augmenting the frequency
   of ejaculations, but by increasing the amount of sperm in a similar
   number of ejaculations.

AB Many terrestrial mammals scent mark in areas containing the scent marks
   of conspecifics, and thus, may deposit their own scent marks on top of
   those that were deposited previously by conspecifics. This phenomenon,
   known as over-marking appears to play a role in same-sex competition or
   mate attraction. The present study determines whether meadow and prairie
   voles avoid over-marking the scent marks of conspecifics, target the
   scent marks of conspecifics and over-mark them, or randomly over-mark
   the scent marks of conspecifics. The data show that meadow and prairie
   voles adjust the number and location of scent marks that they deposit in
   areas marked previously by particular conspecifics. Male and female
   meadow and prairie voles target the scent marks of opposite-sex
   conspecifics and over-mark them. Female meadow and prairie voles also
   target the scent marks of female conspecifics. In contrast, male meadow
   and prairie voles over-mark the scent marks of male conspecifics in a
   random manner. By differentially over-marking the scent marks of
   conspecifics, voles may be able to communicate particular information to
   a variety of conspecifics.

AB Self-grooming in response to the odours of an opposite-sex conspecific
   may reflect sexual motivation on the part of the actor. We tested the
   hypothesis that meadow voles, Microtus pennsylvanicus, and prairie
   voles, M. ochrogaster, both self-groom at different rates when exposed
   to the odours of their siblings as compared to those of nonsiblings.
   This prediction was studied under the context of social memory for
   siblings and the effects of isolation on memory for siblings. The
   hypothesis explains the self-grooming responses of meadow voles isolated
   from their siblings for 10 days and of prairie voles isolated from their
   siblings for 20 days. However, 20 days of isolation for male and female
   meadow voles, and 30 days of isolation for male prairie voles were
   sufficient to induce these animals to self-groom at a similar rate to
   both sibling and nonsibling odours, suggesting that after isolation
   these animals no longer recognized their opposite-sex siblings. Female
   prairie voles isolated for 30 days self-groomed more in response to the
   odours of male nonsiblings than to those of male siblings, suggesting
   that female prairie voles still recognize their male siblings after
   isolation. This study is the first to provide empirical evidence that,
   in the context of sibling recognition, self-grooming behaviour is
   directed at unfamiliar opposite-sex conspecifics, and that the
   communicative function of self-grooming (sexual motivation) is
   associated with social memory for siblings. Differences in the
   self-grooming behaviour of meadow voles and prairie voles may be
   associated with several aspects of their life history characteristics.

AB Scent over-marking occurs when an animal places its scent mark directly
   on top of another individual's scent mark. However, situations may arise
   in which the top- and bottom-scent donors of an over-mark differ in an
   individual characteristic(s), for example, gonadal hormone titres. We
   tested the hypothesis that adult meadow voles, Microtus pennsylvanicus,
   preferentially respond to a gonadectomized donor treated with gonadal
   steroid hormones over a gonadectomized donor not treated with gonadal
   steroid hormones, independently of the position of the scent marks in an
   over-mark. Male meadow voles spent more time investigating the scent
   marks of gonadectomized females treated with oestradiol than that of
   gonadectomized females treated with no oestradiol, independently of the
   position of the two scent marks in the over-mark. Female voles spent
   more time investigating the scent marks of gonadectomized males treated
   with testosterone than that of gonadectomized males treated with no
   testosterone, only when the former males were the top-scent donors.
   These results suggest that male meadow voles appear to base their
   preference on the oestradiol titre of females, rather than the position
   of the female's mark in an over-mark. In contrast, female meadow voles
   appear to use both the position of the male's scent mark in an over-mark
   and the male's testosterone titre for the basis of their preference. (C)

AB Scent over-marking occurs when one individual places its scent mark on
   top of one deposited by a conspecific. Studies have shown that animals
   investigating an over-mark later behave as if the top-scent mark is more
   important than the bottom-scent mark. Differences in response to
   over-marks may reflect differences in social and mating systems. Here,
   we ascertained the length of time that meadow voles (Microtus
   pennsylvanicus) and prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster), exposed to an
   over-mark, maintain a preference for the mark of the top-scent donor
   compared with that of the bottom-scent donor. If voles had no previous
   sexual experience with their top-scent and bottom-scent donors, male and
   female meadow voles maintained a preference for their top-scent donor's
   mark over their bottom-scent donor's mark for 48 h. In contrast, male
   and female prairie voles maintained such preferences for 24 h and 12 h,
   respectively. If voles had prior sexual experience with either their
   top- or bottom-scent donor, such experience did not affect the length of
   time meadow voles and male prairie voles maintained a preference for
   their top-scent donor. Female prairie voles maintained a 12-h preference
   for the top-scent mark if it belonged to the mate. If the mate was the
   bottom-scent donor, female prairie voles showed no preference for it or
   the top-scent mark. These findings are discussed within the framework
   that an association may exist between the manner in which voles respond
   to over-marks and their social and mating systems.

AB Observations of numerous mammals suggest males self-groom more than
   females in response to the odours of opposite-sex conspecifics. Two
   experiments tested the hypothesis that self-grooming may be a tactic
   used by males to attract mates in prairie voles Microtus ochrogaster. In
   the first experiment, we measured the amounts of time voles self-groomed
   during exposure either to male-scented cotton bedding, female-scented
   cotton bedding, or clean cotton bedding. Results from this experiment
   support the hypothesis and also show that female prairie voles
   self-groom in response to odours of males. In addition, male prairie
   voles groom more in response to male odours than to female odours,
   suggesting that self-grooming also serves a role in male-male
   competition. In the second experiment, male and female voles spent more
   time investigating scent marks of opposite-sex conspecifics that
   recently self-groomed at a higher rate than those of opposite-sex
   conspecifics that self-groomed at a lower rate. Female, but not male
   prairie voles, spent more time investigating scent marks of opposite-sex
   conspecifics that self-groomed at a high rate than those of same-sex
   conspecifics that self-groomed at a high rate. For prairie voles,
   self-grooming may increase the detection of their scent marks by
   conspecifics. By self-grooming, prairie voles may be attempting to
   attract opposite-sex conspecifics, and males may also be attempting to
   deter encounters with male conspecifics.

AB The sources of sexually discriminable scent were identified for montane
   voles, Microtus montanus, and compared with known sources in other
   species of voles. I tested two different hypotheses. The data support
   the hypothesis that each vole species has a unique number and pattern of
   sources of sexually distinct scent. The location, pattern, and number of
   these sources of scent on the integument may allow individuals to convey
   particular types of information to conspecifics. The data also support
   the hypothesis that the greater the number of sources of scent for
   signaling opposite-sex conspecifics, the greater the number of
   encounters that individuals within that species have with opposite-sex
   conspecifics. The montane vole, a semisocial species, has six sources of
   scent, which is intermediate between the numbers found in the meadow
   vole (Microtus pennsylvanicus), an asocial species, and the prairie vole
   (Microtus ochrogaster), a social species. The results suggest that the
   number, pattern, and locations of sexually distinct scents are
   positively associated with the frequency with which individuals
   encounter the scent marks of neighboring conspecifics.

AB Over-marking occurs when one individual deposits its scent mark on the
   scent mark of a conspecific. Previous studies have shown that meadow
   voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus) and prairie voles (M. ochrogaster) that
   were exposed to an over-mark of two same-sex conspecifics, later
   responded similarly to the top-scent mark but differed in their response
   to the bottom-scent mark. In the present study, we examined the
   responses of meadow voles and prairie voles to same-sex and mixed-sex
   over-marks to ascertain whether their responses reflect the different
   tactics which males and females in promiscuous (meadow voles) and
   monogamous (prairie voles) species use to attract opposite-sex
   conspecifics and to compete with same-sex conspecifics. Males and
   females of both species spent more time investigating the mark of the
   top-scent donor than that of the bottom-scent donor of an over-mark.
   Meadow voles exposed to a mixed-sex over-mark spent more time
   investigating the mark of the opposite-sex conspecific independently of
   whether it was from the top- or bottom-scent donor. In contrast, prairie
   voles spent more time investigating the mark of the opposite-sex donor
   if it was from the top-scent donor. These results suggest that: (i)
   over-marking serves a competitive function; (ii) the scent marks of
   individuals attract multiple mates in promiscuous species such as the
   meadow vole; and (iii) the scent marks of individuals establish and
   maintain pair bonds between familiar opposite-sex conspecifics in
   monogamous species such as the prairie vole.

AB Previous work shows that after investigating a same-sex over-mark, two
   nonmonogamous species, meadow voles and golden hamsters, preferred the
   odor of the top-scent donor to that of the bottom-scent donor, and
   behaved as the odor of the bottom-scent donor was not familiar. This
   finding supported the scent-masking hypothesis; one of three hypotheses
   suggested previously to account for how an animal responds to the
   overlapping scent marks of two same-sex conspecifics. The present
   experiments tested whether one of these hypotheses, either
   scent-masking, scent-bulletin-board, or scent-blending, predicts how a
   monogamous species, the prairie vole, responds to such over-marks. Our
   data show that none of the three hypotheses adequately describes the way
   in which prairie voles respond to conspecific over-marks. Although
   prairie voles preferred the top scent to the bottom scent, they behaved
   as if the latter scent was familiar and less important than a novel
   scent (a scent not part of the over-mark). Overall, the data suggest
   that the manner in which males and females respond to same-sex
   over-marks reflects the different tactics they may use to attract and
   compete with conspecifics in monogamous and nonmonogamous species.

AB Studies on nonseasonally breeding males have demonstrated that high
   titers of testosterone (T) stimulate reproduction, whereas high titers
   of prolactin (PRL) inhibit it. Recent evidence, however, suggests that
   for seasonally breeding males high titers of both PRL and T stimulate
   behaviors that support reproduction and mating. Thus, we hypothesized
   that high titers of both PRL and T are necessary and sufficient for male
   meadow voles to show a preference for the odor of long-photoperiod (LP)
   females. We tested this hypothesis by treating castrated LP males with
   bromocriptine and/or T, and by treating castrated short-photoperiod (SP)
   males with PRL and/or T. The data showed that high titers of both PRL
   and T are necessary for LP male meadow voles to maintain a preference
   for the odor of LP female meadow voles, but high titers of both hormones
   are not sufficient to induce SP males to show such a preference. Only SP
   males with high T and low PRL titers showed preferences for LP female
   odors. Interestingly, SP males with high PRL and high T titers preferred
   the odor of LP males, and SP males with high PRL and low T titers
   preferred the odors of SP females. The apparent contradictory effects of
   PRL and T in SP males suggest that the hormonal control of seasonal
   differences of male odor preferences may be more complex than previously
   believed. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Scent over-marking occurs when an animal deposits its scent mark on top

   Given that male rodents usually scent mark more than females and that
   animals spend more time investigating the odor of the top-scent donor of
   an over-mark, I tested the following three hypotheses. First, male
   meadow voles deposit more scent marks than female meadow voles. Second,
   male meadow voles will deposit more over-marks and adjacent-marks in
   response to the scent marks of a same-sex conspecific than females
   would. Third, meadow voles spend more time investigating the odor of the
   second vole placed in the arena than that of the first vole placed in
   the arena. To test these hypotheses, two age-matched, like-sex
   conspecifics (first vole and second vole) were placed successively into
   an arena in which they were allowed to freely explore and scent mark for
   15 min. The first hypothesis was not supported. The first and second
   vole, independently of sex, deposited a similar number of scent marks.
   The second hypothesis was also not supported by the data: more
   conspecific scent marks were over-marked by the second female than by
   the second male. The third hypothesis was supported by the data. After
   investigating a scented arena, males and females spent more time
   investigating the odor of the second vole than that of the first vole.
   Sex differences in scent-marking behaviors of meadow voles are unlike
   those reported for other species of rodents.

AB Olfactory cues can contain information for discrimination of gender that
   can affect subsequent social interactions. Social rodents are
   hypothesized to use more olfactory cues than nonsocial rodents to
   distinguish males from females. The generality of this hypothesis was
   tested using the pine vole (Microtus pinetorum), a social vole. We
   examined nine possible sources of odors. A slide containing an odor from
   a male and a female was presented to each test subject for 3 min. We
   recorded the amount of time each test subject spent investigating each
   odor. Females spent significantly more time investigating male urine and
   male anogenital odors; however, they did nor use any other odor sources
   to discriminate gender. In contrast, males did not use any odor sources
   to discriminate gender. Our results do not support the hypothesis that
   all social rodents use numerous odor sources to discriminate gender.
   Instead, our results are consistent with the alternative hypothesis that
   use of odor sources to convey information about gender may differ in
   rodents that live in different microhabitats.

AB Scent over-marking occurs when an animal deposits its scent mark on top
   of the scent mark of a conspecific. Over-marking may provide advantages
   in the transfer of information to the individual whose scent is on top
   but not to the individual whose scent is on the bottom. We tested the
   hypothesis that over-marking is a competitive form of olfactory
   communication and that male prairie voles would over-mark the scent
   marks of same-sex conspecifics more than those of same-sex siblings. Two
   age-matched male voles (first male and second male) were placed
   successively into an arena in which they were allowed to explore freely
   and scent mark for 15 min at age 12, 20, 28, 36, 44, and 52 d. The first
   male was placed into a clean arena, whereas the second male was placed
   into an arena containing either the scent marks of an age-matched male
   sibling or nonsibling. Age affected the total number of scent marks
   deposited by the voles; 12-20-d-old voles deposited fewer scent marks,
   over-marks and adjacent marks than did 28-52-d-old voles. Sibship did
   not affect the total number of scent marks deposited by the first and
   second voles but did affect the number of over-marks and adjacent marks
   deposited by the second vole. Siblings received significantly fewer
   over-marks and adjacent marks than did nonsiblings; this effect was most
   dramatic after the voles reached 28 d of age, a time coincident with the
   onset of puberty. Malts separated from siblings and housed singly at
   44-d-old and tested at 52-d-old, deposited significantly more over-marks
   and adjacent marks in arenas if the first vole was a nonsibling than if
   it was a sibling. This differential scent-marking supports the
   hypothesis that over-marking and adjacent marking are used as
   competitive forms of olfactory communication by male prairie voles.

AB Scent over-marking is a common form of competitive advertisement among
   many species of mammals. Recent observations in golden hamsters,
   Mesocricetus auratus, have suggested that individuals have specialized
   mechanisms for interpretation of and response to such over-marks. In
   this study, we examined whether meadow voles, Microtus pennsylvanicus,
   have similar abilities. Female voles were first exposed to anogenital
   scent marks of two males and were then tested in a Y-maze for their
   preferences for whole-body odours of these two males. Experiments were
   run using a variety of configurations of scent marks during the exposure
   phase, but all experiments yielded consistent results. If the scent
   marks of the two males overlapped, females later preferred the
   whole-body odours of the male whose scent was on top; if the two scent
   marks did not overlap, females showed no preference. Females also
   preferred odours of familiar males over novel males, and preferred both
   top-scent and bottom-scent males over novel males. The results suggest
   that female voles can tell which individual's scent is on top in an
   over-mark and that they prefer this top-scent male, even though they
   know that both males' scents were present during the exposure phase. We
   suggest that these odour preferences reflect mate preferences and
   discuss possible reasons why females might prefer top-scent males. (C)

AB Scent counter-marking, in which one individual deposits scent in close
   proximity to the scent of another individual, is a widespread bur poorly
   understood aspect of olfactory communication. Recent work with golden
   hamsters suggests that animals may have specially evolved mechanisms for
   determining which individual has marked most recently, and this work
   emphasizes the need for studies with other species. In Experiment 1 it
   was shown for the first time that male meadow voles, Microtus
   pennsylvanicus, scent mark with urine and anogenital scents and probably
   also counter-mark with these scents. Female meadow voles, after
   investigation of an area marked by two males, preferred the whole-body
   odours of the male that had marked the arena most recently (Experiment
   2). After females investigated a male's home cage that had just been
   marked by another male, they again preferred the whole-body odours of
   the male that had marked in the cage most recently (Experiment 3). These
   results demonstrate that female voles,like male hamsters, can
   distinguish the top or most recent individual's scent from the bottom or
   older scent in places marked by two males, and further indicate that
   female voles may prefer the individual that deposited the top scent.
   Taken together, the results suggest that counter-marking by male voles
   may be a type of competitive advertising and that females may base
   mate-choke decisions on information from the pattern of such
   counter-marks.

AB This study investigated the roles of testosterone and prolactin in
   seasonal changes in the attractiveness of odors of male meadow voles to
   long-photoperiod females. Prolactin was reduced in long-photoperiod
   males by treatment with bromocryptine (Experiment 1) and increased in
   short-photoperiod males by replacement with ovine prolactin (Experiment
   2). Testosterone was manipulated by castration and testosterone
   replacement. During long photoperiods, the attractiveness of the odor
   produced by male meadow voles depends on the circulating titers of both
   prolactin and testosterone. Males with high titers of both hormones
   produced scents that were highly attractive to females; those with low
   titers of both hormones produced unattractive scents. When the
   concentration of one hormone was high and the other low,
   long-photoperiod males produced scents of intermediate attractiveness.
   During short photoperiods, the attractiveness of the male's scents
   depended strictly on his prolactin titers. Males with high prolactin
   titers produced attractive scents, and males with low prolactin titers
   produced unattractive scents, regardless of their prolactin
   concentrations. Thus, high titers of both testosterone and prolactin are
   needed to produce attractive scents in males exposed to long
   photoperiods, whereas high prolactin titers are sufficient in
   short-photoperiod males. (C) 1997 Academic Press.

AB Seasonal differences exist in the attractiveness of scents in meadow
   voles, Microtus pennsylvanicus. To determine whether photoperiodically
   induced changes in the attractiveness of a sex-specific scent is
   governed by melatonin, we implanted long-photoperiod male and female
   scent donors with a Silastic implant containing a 10-mm active length of
   melatonin, a 20-mm active length of melatonin, or no melatonin. The
   first experiment shows that 8 weeks of melatonin treatment is sufficient
   to induce long-photoperiod voles to produce scents that are no longer
   attractive to the opposite sex. The second experiment shows that a
   similar time course of melatonin treatment was sufficient to induce
   long-photoperiod females treated with melatonin to produce scents that
   are attractive to short-photoperiod females. Melatonin implants lowered
   the gonadal hormone titers and reduced the weight of the gonads of
   treated long-photoperiod voles to titers and weights that are
   characteristic of short-photoperiod voles. In both experiments, the
   behavioral and physiological effects were independent of whether scent
   donors received 10- or 20-mm implants of melatonin. Together, the
   results of the two experiments reveal that melatonin mediates the
   photoperiodically induced changes in gonadal hormone titers that control
   the seasonal differences in the sexual attractiveness of the anogenital
   area scent produced by meadow voles. (C) 1996 Academic Press, Inc.

AB Self-grooming may provide a means for broadcasting scent to
   conspecifics. Four experiments investigated this hypothesis in meadow
   voles. In the first experiment, male voles but not female voles groomed
   more in response to scent from an opposite-sex conspecific than a
   same-sex conspecific. In the second experiment, male voles groomed more
   in response to ovariectomized females receiving replacement oestradiol
   than to ovariectomized females receiving no oestradiol replacement.
   Self-grooming by female voles did not vary with the reproductive state
   of male scent donors. In the third experiment, males showed no
   difference in grooming in response to odours of a short-photoperiod male
   versus a short-photoperiod female, again indicating that the grooming
   response of males depends on the reproductive state of scent donors.
   These three experiments all suggested a communicative function for
   scent-elicited grooming. In the final experiment, the responses of
   females to males that had engaged in self-grooming was examined. Females
   spent more time investigating scent collected from the anogenital area
   of a male that had recently self-groomed at a high rate than they did
   from a male that had groomed at a low rate. Thus self-grooming by males
   increases the attractiveness of at least one of their scents to females.

AB The function of an odour may be reflected in its fade-out time in the
   environment. In this study, we investigated fade-out times of two
   specific odours, the anogenital area scent and that of the
   posterolateral region. These two odours support opposite-sex preferences
   in male and female meadow voles, Microtus pennsylvanicus, but convey
   nonidentical information to conspecifics during the breeding season. The
   first experiment tested whether meadow voles respond preferentially to
   scents chat were aged for 15 min (fresh) to 30 d. Males preferred female
   anogenital area scent to male anogenital area scent if both scents were
   less than or equal to 10 d old. By comparison, females preferred male
   anogenital area scent to female anogenital area scent if the scents were
   less than or equal to 25 d old. However, male and female voles preferred
   the posterolateral scene of males to that of females if the scents were
   less than or equal to 1 d old. Thus, fade-out times for these two scents
   differ for males and females, suggesting different functions. In the
   second experiment, male and female voles preferred fresh anogenital area
   scent and fresh posterolateral region scene compared with those same
   scents that were older. This result suggests that older scents may have
   lost information over rime about the sex of the donor. Overall, data
   from both experiments indicate that voles may use specific scenes for
   communication in different social contexts.

AB Relatively little is known about the mechanisms of communication during
   the non-breeding season in species that are seasonal breeders. Previous
   work with meadow voles, Microtus pennsylvanicus, housed under long
   photoperiods, has shown that they prefer the odors of opposite-sex
   conspecifics. In this paper, we investigated the effects of short
   photoperiod on preferences for sex-specific odors and the production of
   such odors. Short-photoperiod females preferred anogenital and fecal
   scents of other short-photoperiod females over those of males, but did
   not show sexual preferences for three other scents. Short-photoperiod
   males did not exhibit sexual preferences for any of the odors.
   Furthermore, scents from short-photoperiod voles did not elicit
   sex-specific preferences in long photoperiod voles, and scents from
   long-photoperiod voles did not elicit preferences from short-photoperiod
   voles. These and previous results indicate that both the odors and
   responses to odors change seasonally and that long-photoperiod voles
   respond selectively to scents from long-photoperiod voles and
   short-photoperiod voles respond selectively to scents from
   short-photoperiod voles. Taken together, these results suggest the
   co-evolution of seasonal changes in scents and in perceptual or other
   response mechanisms.

AB Although many sources of sexually specific chemical signals have been
   identified, few attempts have been made to identify all the sources of
   sex-specific information in any species or to determine whether the
   various cues that provide this information have the same communicative
   functions. Sources of sex-specific odour information were identified
   using a preference task in meadow voles. An examination was made of the
   amount of time that long-photoperiod male and female voles investigated
   different scents from opposite- and same-sex conspecifics. The data
   indicate that there was a highly localized pattern of sexual information
   on the bodies of meadow voles. Three scents were preferentially
   investigated by opposite-sex subjects: both male and female voles
   investigated scents from urine, faeces and the anogenital area of the
   opposite sex more than those of the same sex. Two additional scents
   resulted in sexual preferences, but not in a symmetrical fashion. Males
   investigated scents from the mouth of females over the mouth scent of
   males, but females showed no preference. Both males and females
   investigated scent from the posterolateral region of males more than
   those of females. Mouth and posterolateral area may provide different
   information and/or have different functions compared to the sex-specific
   scents from urine, faeces and the anogenital area.

AB The presence or absence of specific odor-producing tissues has been used
   to suggest phylogenetic relationships among microtine rodents, but has
   not been related to patterns of social organization. We examined the
   sources of sex-specific scents in prairie voles, Microtus ochrogaster,
   using a preference task. Prairie voles have eight sources of
   sex-specific scents. Four scents, namely those from the urine, feces,
   anogenital area, and mouth were more attractive to opposite- than
   same-sex conspecifics. Three scents were attractive to one sex but not
   the other. Scent from the back of females was attractive to males and
   scents from the chest and head - neck - ears of males were attractive to
   females. Scent from the male posterolateral region was attractive to
   both females and males. We then compared these eight sources of scent
   with the known sources of scent from meadow voles, Microtus
   pennsylvanicus, a species whose social system is unlike that of prairie
   voles. Prairie voles have more sources of sex-specific scent than meadow
   voles. This difference supports the hypothesis that the number of
   sources of sex-specific scent is greater in a social species (prairie
   voles) than in an asocial species (meadow voles).

AB Meadow voles exhibit seasonal changes in litter size, ovulation rates,
   and prenatal mortality. To investigate the proximate bases of seasonal
   changes in reproductive effort, adult female voles, maintained in long
   photoperiods (14 h of light/day), were injected daily with 10 mu g
   melatonin 2 h before light offset to extend the duration of the
   nighttime melatonin pulse. At parturition the number, sex, and weight of
   offspring were assessed. The number of ovarian corpora Lutea (CL), an
   index of potential Litter size, was used to calculate rates of prenatal
   survival (i.e., pups per CL). Prenatal survival rates were reduced in
   female but not male pups of dams that had been injected before
   blastocyst implantation (Days 1-6 of pregnancy) with melatonin as
   compared with saline. Melatonin injections initiated after blastocyst
   implantation (Days 7-21 of pregnancy) did not affect prenatal survival,
   nor were birth weights of pups affected by either pre- or
   postimplantation melatonin treatment. We conclude that sex-specific
   prenatal survival is a labile feature of vole reproduction that may be
   under proximate control of photoperiod and melatonin before blastocyst
   implantation.

   may cause differences in the attractiveness of male odors to female
   meadow voles, Microtus pennsylvanicus. Males that were to be used as
   odor donors were castrated and implanted with Silastic capsules filled
   with no hormone or one of four different amounts of testosterone. Four
   different odors from males were assessed for each comparison; the odors
   were from the anogenital area, feces, urine, and posterolateral region.
   Treatment of scent donor males with the lowest dosage of testosterone
   was not sufficient to increase the attractiveness of their odors above
   that of males receiving no hormone. The three higher dosages increased
   attractiveness in a dose-dependent manner. The shape of the
   dose-response curve differed across scents: two scents reached maximum
   attractiveness in the middle of the dose range and remained there at
   higher doses, whereas the other two scents continued to increase in
   attractiveness as testosterone titers increased. The results suggest
   that scent glands produce graded signals that reflect circulating
   testosterone titers.

   nonresponder female over responder female odors. Nonresponder males
   preferred nonresponder over responder female odors. The mutual
   attraction between male - female and female - female nonresponders may
   facilitate winter breeding and female-female dyad formation for communal
   rearing of young, respectively. Responder females preferred odors of
   female responders over those of male responders and responder over
   nonresponder male odors. Olfactory preferences of nonresponder short-day
   voles were not equivalent to those of reproductively competent long-day
   animals. Differences in odor communication between responder and
   nonresponder voles are attributable only in part to differences in
   gonadal hormone secretion.
