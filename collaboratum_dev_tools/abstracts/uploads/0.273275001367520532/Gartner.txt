AB Objective-Integrins mediate platelet adhesion and transmit outside-in
   signals leading to platelet spreading. Phosphoinositide 3-kinases
   (PI3Ks) play a critical role in outside-in signaling and platelet
   spreading; however, the mechanisms of PI3K activation and function in
   outside-in signaling are unclear. We sought to determine the role of the
   Akt family of serine/threonine kinases and activation mechanisms of the
   PI3K/Akt pathway in outside-in signaling.
   Methods and Results-Akt inhibitors and Akt3 knockout inhibited platelet
   spreading on fibrinogen, indicating that Akt is important in integrin
   outside-in signaling. Akt inhibitors and Akt3 knockout also diminished
   integrin-dependent phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta.
   Inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta reversed the inhibitory
   effects of Akt3 knockout and inhibitors of Akt or PI3K on platelet
   spreading, indicating that glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta is a
   downstream target of Akt in outside-in signaling. Integrin-dependent
   activation of the PI3K-Akt pathway requires Src family kinase. Akt
   phosphorylation is also significantly inhibited in ADP receptor P2Y12
   knockout platelets and further inhibited in P2Y12 knockout platelets
   treated with a P2Y1 antagonist. Consistently, P2Y12 knockout and P2Y1
   inhibition together reduced platelet spreading.
   Conclusion-These results demonstrate that integrin outside-in signaling
   and platelet spreading requires Src family kinase-dependent and ADP
   receptor-amplified activation of the PI3K-Akt-GSK-3 beta pathway.

TI Peptide LSARLAF induces integrin beta 3 dependent outside-in signaling

AB Introduction: Peptide LSARLAF (LSA) can bind and activate integrin alpha
   IIb beta 3 in the absence of 'inside-out' signal. The active alpha IIb
   beta 3 mediates 'outside-in' signaling that elicits platelet
   aggregation, granule secretion and TxA2 production. Here we identify the
   membrane glycoproteins which mediate LSA-induced platelet activation
   other than alpha IIb beta 3, and determine the roles of Src, PLC gamma
   2, FcR gamma-chain, and SLP-76 in LSA-induced platelet activation.
   Method: Ligand-receptor binding assay was performed to study the effect
   of peptide LSA or its control peptide FRALASL (FRA) on integrins binding
   to their ligands. Spreading of CHO cells expressing alpha IIb beta 3 or
   alpha V beta 3 on immobilized fibrinogen was measured in the presence of
   LSA or FRA. Washed beta 3, Src, FcR gamma-chain, LAT and SLP-76
   deficient platelets aggregation and secretion were tested in response to
   LSA.
   Results: Ligand-receptor binding assay indicated that LSA promoted the
   binding of multiple ligands to alpha IIb beta 3 or alpha V beta 3. LSA
   also enhanced CHO cells with alpha IIb beta 3 or alpha V beta 3
   expression spreading on immobilized fibrinogen. beta 3 deficient
   platelets failed to aggregate and secrete in response to LSA. The
   phosphorylation of PLC gamma 2 and Syk was also beta 3 dependent. Src,
   FcR gamma-chain, LAT and SLP-76 deficient platelets did not aggregate,
   secrete ATP or produce TxA2 in response to LSA.
   Conclusion: LSA-induced platelet activation is beta 3 dependent, and
   signaling molecules Src, FcR gamma-chain, SLP-76 and LAT play crucial
   roles in LSA-induced beta 3 mediated signaling. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Objective-The aim of the study was to evaluate the role of purinergic
   receptor P2Y, G protein-coupled 12 (P2Y12), an ADP receptor, in the
   development of atherosclerotic lesions.
   Methods and Results-Apolipoprotein E-null mice were crossed with
   P2y12(-/-) mice to generate double knockout mice. The double knockout
   mice and the control apolipoprotein E-null mice were fed a high-fat diet
   for 20 weeks. Assessment of the atherosclerotic lesions in the control
   and double knockout mice demonstrated that P2Y12 deficiency caused a
   diminished lesion area, an increased fibrous content at the plaque site,
   and decreased monocyte/macrophage infiltration of the lesions.
   Polymerase chain reaction studies revealed that white blood cells do not
   express significant levels of P2Y12. Bone marrow transplantation
   experiments confirmed that P2Y12 expressed on platelets is a key factor
   responsible for atherosclerosis, but do not exclude a role of smooth
   muscle cell P2Y12. Supernatant fluid from activated P2y12(+/+) but not
   P2y12-/- platelets was capable of causing monocyte migration. In vitro
   studies showed that platelet P2Y12 deficiency suppressed platelet factor
   4 secretion and P-selectin expression. Further work demonstrated that
   platelet P2Y12, through inhibition of the cAMP/protein kinase A pathway,
   critically regulates the release of platelet factor 4, and thereby
   affects monocyte recruitment and infiltration.
   Conclusion-These results demonstrate that P2Y12 modulates atherogenesis,
   at least in part by augmenting inflammatory cell recruitment via
   regulation of platelet alpha-granule release. (Arterioscler Thromb Vasc
   Biol. 2012;32:e81-e89.)

AB Rap1b is activated by platelet agonists and plays a critical role in
   integrin alpha(IIb)beta(3) inside-out signaling and platelet
   aggregation. Here we show that agonist-induced Rap1b activation plays an
   important role in stimulating secretion of platelet granules. We also
   show that alpha(IIb)beta(3) outside-in signaling can activate Rap1b, and
   integrin outside-in signaling-mediated Rap1b activation is important in
   facilitating platelet spreading on fibrinogen and clot retraction.
   Rap1b-deficient platelets had diminished ATP secretion and P-selectin
   expression induced by thrombin or collagen. Importantly, addition of low
   doses of ADP and/or fibrinogen restored aggregation of Rap1b-deficient
   platelets. Furthermore, we found that Rap1b was activated by platelet
   spreading on immobilized fibrinogen, a process that was not affected by
   P2Y(12) or TXA(2) receptor deficiency, but was inhibited by the
   selective Src inhibitor PP2, the PKC inhibitor Ro-31-8220, or the
   calcium chelator demethyl-1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)
   ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid tetrakis. Clot retraction was
   abolished, and platelet spreading on fibrinogen was diminished in
   Rap1b-deficient platelets compared with wild-type controls. The defects
   in clot retraction and spreading on fibrinogen of Rap1b-deficient
   platelets were not rescued by addition of MnCl2, which elicits
   alpha(IIb)beta(3) outside-in signaling in the absence of inside-out
   signaling. Thus, our results reveal two different activation mechanisms
   of Rap1b as well as novel functions of Rap1b in platelet secretion and
   in integrin alpha(IIb)beta(3) outside-in signaling.

AB Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) has been shown to play an important
   role in collagen-induced platelet activation, but the role(s) of PTEN, a
   major regulator of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, has not been examined
   in platelets. Here, we report that Pten(-/-) mouse blood contains 25%
   more platelets than Pten(+/+) blood and that PTEN deficiency
   significantly shortened the bleeding time, increased the sensitivity of
   platelets to collagen-induced activation and aggregation, and enhanced
   phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473 in response to collagen. Furthermore,
   we found that PP2, and the combination of apyrase, indomethacin + 1B5,
   respectively, inhibited collagen-induced aggregation in both PTEN(+/+)
   and PTEN(-/-) platelets. In contrast, LY294002 (a PI3K inhibitor)
   prevented the aggregation of PTEN(+/+), but not PTEN(-/-), platelets.
   Therefore, PTEN apparently regulates collagen-induced platelet
   activation through PI3K/Akt-dependent and -independent signaling
   pathways. (Blood. 2010;116(14):2579-2581)

AB Background: The serine-threonine kinase Akt plays an important role in
   regulating platelet activation. Stimulation of platelets with various
   agonists results in Akt activation as indicated by Akt phosphorylation.
   However, the mechanisms of Akt phosphorylation in platelets are not
   completely understood. Objectives and Methods: We used P2Y(12) knockout
   mice to address the role of P2Y(12) in Akt phosphorylation in response
   to thrombin receptors in platelets. Results: Thrombin or the PAR4
   thrombin receptor peptide AYPGKF at high concentrations stimulated
   substantial phosphorylation of Akt residues Thr(308) and Ser(473) in
   P2Y(12)-deficient platelets. AYPGKF-induced Akt phosphorylation is
   enhanced by expression of recombinant human PAR4 cDNA in Chinese hamster
   ovary (CHO) cells. P2Y(12)-independent Akt phosphorylation was not
   inhibited by integrin inhibitor peptide RGDS or integrin beta(3)
   deficiency. Akt phosphorylation induced by thrombin or AYPGKF in
   P2Y(12)-deficient platelets was inhibited by the calcium chelator
   dimethyl-BAPTA, the Src family kinase inhibitor PP2, and PI3K
   inhibitors, respectively. Conclusions: Our results reveal a novel
   P2Y(12)-independent signaling pathway mediating Akt phosphorylation in
   response to thrombin receptors.

AB Antiplatelet therapy for the management of patients with cardiovascular
   risks often includes a combination therapy of aspirin and clopidogrel,
   acting through inhibition of thromboxane generation and blockade of
   G(i)-coupled P2Y(12) receptor, respectively. We hypothesized that ADP
   acting through P2Y(12) regulates physiological thromboxane levels. The
   serum thromboxane levels in mice (n = 3) dosed with clopidogrel and
   prasugrel were decreased by 83.1 +/- 5.3% and 94.26 +/- 1.75%
   respectively compared to untreated mice. Pre-treatment of human blood (n
   = 3) ex vivo with active metabolites of clopidogrel or prasugrel led to
   a reduction in thromboxane levels to 16.3 +/- 3.2% and 4.9 +/- 0.8%
   respectively, compared to untreated human serum. We also evaluated serum
   thromboxane levels in P2Y receptor null mice (n = 4). Whereas serum
   thromboxane levels in P2Y(1) null mice were similar to those in wild
   type littermates, those in the P2Y(12) null mice were inhibited by 83.15
   +/- 3.8%. Finally, in a pilot study, serum thromboxane levels were
   reduced by 76.05 +/- 8.41% in healthy human volunteers (n = 6) upon
   dosing with clopidogrel, compared to the levels before dosing. In
   conclusion, P2Y(12) antagonism alone can decrease physiological
   thromboxane levels. Thus, this study could pave way the for
   newer/modified treatment regimens for the management of patients with
   thrombotic complications who are allergic or non-responsive to
   aspirin.</.

AB Platelet-type von Willebrand disease (PT-VWD) is a bleeding disorder of
   the platelet glycoprotein Ib-IX/von Willebrand factor (VWF) axis caused
   by mutations in the glycoprotein Ib-IX receptor that lead to an
   increased affinity with VWF. In this report, platelets from a mouse
   expressing a mutation associated with PT-VWD have been visualized using
   state-of-the art image collection and processing. Confocal analysis
   revealed that VWF bound to the surface of single platelets and bridging
   micro-aggregates of platelets. Surface-bound VWF appears as a large,
   linear structure on the surface of 50% of the PT-VWD platelets. In vivo
   thrombus formation after chemical injury to the carotid artery revealed
   a severe impairment to occlusion as a consequence of the PT-VWD
   mutation. In vitro stimulation of PT-VWD platelets with adenosine
   diphosphate or thrombin demonstrates a significant block in their
   ability to bind fibrinogen. The impairment of in vivo thrombus formation
   and in vitro fibrinogen binding are more significant than might be
   expected from the observed platelet binding to VWF polymers over a small
   portion of the plasma membrane. Visualization of the receptor/ligand
   interaction and characterization of a severe antithrombotic phenotype
   provide a new understanding on the molecular basis of bleeding
   associated with the PT-VWD phenotype. (Blood. 2009; 114: 5541-5546)

AB Background: A signaling pathway is difficult, if not impossible, to
   elucidate in platelets using only in vivo studies. Likewise, the
   physiological significance of signaling information obtained exclusively
   from in vitro observations is unknown. Therefore, both in vitro and in
   vivo experiments are required to establish the physiological
   significance of a signaling pathway. Objective: To evaluate the
   physiological significance of signaling data obtained from botrocetin
   (bt)/von Willebrand factor (VWF)-stimulated washed platelets. Method:
   Stable thrombus formation in response to FeCl(3)-induced injury of the
   mouse carotid artery was used to evaluate the physiological significance
   of signaling data obtained from bt/VWF-stimulated washed platelets.
   Results: Syk, PLC gamma 2, G alpha q and P2Y12, but not LAT, were found
   either to be required for or to affect stable thrombus formation. Prior
   in vitro studies had demonstrated that LAT is not required for
   bt/VWF-induced platelet aggregation in the presence of exogenous
   fibrinogen. These data provide the first demonstration of the in vivo
   role for these signaling molecules in GPIb-dependent/initiated signal
   transduction and are consistent with the signaling pathway deduced from
   in vitro studies of bt/VWF-stimulated washed platelets using metabolic
   inhibitors and knockout mice. Conclusion: The broad agreement between
   the in vitro and the in vivo results establish that bt/VWF stimulation
   of washed platelets can provide physiologically significant glycoprotein
   Ib-dependent/initiated signaling data.

   adhesion on damaged vascular walls by binding to von Willebrand factor

   of GP (GPIb alpha) also binds thrombin but the physiological relevance,
   if any, of this interaction was unknown. Previous studies have shown
   that a sulfated tyrosine 276 (Tyr276) is essential for thrombin binding
   to GPIb alpha.Objectives: This study investigated the in vivo relevance
   of GPIb alpha residue Tyr276 in hemostasis and thrombosis.Methods:
   Transgenic mouse colonies expressing the normal human GPIb alpha subunit
   or a mutant human GPIb alpha containing a Phe substitution for Tyr276
   (hTg(Y276F)) were generated. Both colonies were bred to mice devoid of
   murine GPIb alpha.Results: Surface-expressed GPIb alpha levels and
   platelet counts were similar in both colonies. hTg(Y276F) platelets were
   significantly impaired in binding alpha-thrombin but displayed normal
   binding to type I fibrillar collagen and human VWF in the presence of
   ristocetin. In vivo thrombus formation as a result of chemical damage
   (FeCl3) demonstrated that hTg(Y276F) mice have a delayed time to
   occlusion followed by unstable blood flow indicative of embolization. In
   models of laser-induced injury, thrombi developing in hTg(Y276F) animals
   were also less stable.Conclusions: The results demonstrate that GPIb
   alpha residue Tyr276 is physiologically important, supporting stable
   thrombus formation in vivo.

AB The platelet paradigm in hemostasis and thrombosis involves an
   initiation step that depends on platelet membrane receptors binding to
   ligands on a damaged or inflamed vascular surface. Once bound to the
   surface, platelets provide a unique microenvironment supporting the
   accumulation of more platelets and the elaboration of a fibrin-rich
   network produced by coagulation factors. The platelet-specific receptor
   glycoprotein (GP) lb-IX, is critical in this process and initiates the
   formation of a platelet-rich thrombus by tethering the platelet to a
   thrombogenic surface. A role for platelets beyond the
   hemostasis/thrombosis paradigm is emerging with significant platelet
   contributions in both tumorigenesis and inflammation. We have
   established congenic (N10) mouse colonies (C57BL/6J) with dysfunctional
   GP Ib-1X receptors in our laboratory that allow us an opportunity to
   examine the relevance of platelet GP lb-IX in syngeneic mouse models of
   experimental metastasis. Our results demonstrate platelet GP lb-IX
   contributes to experimental metastasis because a functional absence of
   GP lb-IX correlates with a 15-fold reduction in the number of lung
   metastatic foci using B16F10.1 melanoma cells. The results demonstrate
   that the extracellular domain of the a-subunit of GP lb is the
   structurally relevant component of the GP Ib-IX complex contributing to
   metastasis. Our results support the hypothesis that platelet GP lb-IX
   functions that support normal hemostasis or pathologic thrombosis also
   contribute to tumor malignancy.

AB Botrocetin (bt)-facilitated binding of von Willebrand factor (VWF) to
   the platelet membrane glycoprotein (GP) Ib-IX-V complex on platelets in
   suspension initiates a signaling cascade that causes alpha IIb beta 3
   activation and platelet aggregation. Previous work has demonstrated that
   bt/VWF-mediated agglutination activates alpha IIb beta 3 and elicits ATP
   secretion in a thromboxane A2 (TxA2)-dependent manner. The signaling
   that results in TxA2 production was shown to be initiated by Lyn,
   enhanced by Src, and propagated through Syk, SLP-76, PI3K, PLC gamma 2,
   and PKC. Here, we demonstrate that the signaling elicited by
   GPIb-mediated agglutination that results in TxA2 production is dependent
   on Bruton tyrosine kinase (Btk). The results demonstrate that Btk is
   downstream of Lyn, Syk, SLP-76, and PI3K; upstream of ERK1/2, PLCy2, and
   PKC; and greatly enhances Akt phosphorylation. The relationship(s), if
   any, between ERK1/2, PLC gamma 2, and PKC were not elucidated. The
   requirement for Btk and TxA2 receptor function in GPIb-dependent
   arterial thrombosis was confirmed in vivo by characterizing blood flow
   in ferric chloride-treated mouse carotid arteries. These results
   demonstrate that the Btk family kinase, Tec, cannot provide the
   function(s) missing because of the absence of Btk and that Btk is
   essential for both bt/VWF-mediated agglutination-induced TxA2 production
   and GPIb-dependent stable arterial thrombus formation in vivo.

AB The snake venom rhodocytin has been reported to bind to integrin alpha 2
   beta 1 and glycoprotein (GP) Ib alpha on platelets, but it is also able
   to induce activation independent of the 2 receptors and of GPVI. Using
   rhodocytin affinity chromatography, we have identified a novel C-type
   lectin receptor, CLEC-2, in platelets that confers signaling responses
   to rhodocytin when expressed in a cell line. CLEC-2 has a single
   tyrosine residue in a YXXL motif in its cytosolic tall, which undergoes
   tyrosine phosphorylation upon platelet activation by rhodocytin or an
   antibody to CLEC-2, but not to collagen, thrombin receptor agonist
   peptide (TRAP), or convulxin. Tyrosine phosphorylation of CLEC-2 and
   other signaling proteins by rhodocytin is inhibited by the Src family
   kinase inhibitor PP2. Further, activation of murine platelets by
   rhodocytin is abolished in the absence of Syk and PLC gamma 2, and
   partially reduced in the absence of LAT, SLP-76, and Vav2/Vav3. These
   findings define a novel signaling pathway in platelets whereby
   activation of CLEC-2 by rhodocytin leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of
   its cytosolic tall, binding of Sylk and initiation of downstream
   tyrosine phosphorylation events, and activation of PLCy2. CLEC-2 is the
   first C-type lectin receptor to be found on platelets which signals
   through this novel pathway.

AB Binding of von Willebrand factor (VWF) to the platelet membrane
   glycoprotein (GP) Ib-IX-V complex initiates a signaling cascade that
   causes alpha IIb beta 3 activation and platelet aggregation. Previous
   work demonstrated that botrocetin (bt)/VWF-mediated agglutination
   activates alpha IIb beta 3 and elicits adenosine triphosphate (ATP)
   secretion in a thromboxane A2 (TxA2)- and Ca2+-dependent manner. This
   agglutination-elicited TxA2 production occurs in the absence of ATP
   secretion. However, the signaling components and signaling network or
   pathway activated by GPIb-mediated agglutination to cause TxA2
   production have not been identified. Therefore, the focus of this study
   was to elucidate at least part of the signal transduction network or
   pathway activated by GPIb-mediated agglutination to cause TxA2
   production. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) selective inhibitor
   wortmannin, and mouse platelets deficient in Lyn, Src, Syk, Src homology
   2 (SH2) domain-containing leukocyte protein 76 (SLP-76), phospholipase C
   gamma 2 (PLC72), linker for activation of T cells (LAT), or Fc receptor
   gamma-chain (FcR gamma-chain) were used for these studies. LAT and FcR
   gamma-chain were found not to be required for agglutination-driven TxA2
   production or activation of alpha IIb beta 3, but were required for
   granule secretion and aggregation. The results also clearly demonstrate
   that bt/VWF-mediated agglutination-induced TxA2 production is dependent
   on signaling apparently initiated by Lyn, enhanced by Src, and
   propagated through Syk, SLP-76, PI3K, PLC gamma 2, and protein kinase C
   (PKC).

AB Bidirectional signaling is an essential feature of alpha IIb beta 3
   function. The alpha IIb cytoplasmic domain negatively regulates beta
   3-mediated inside-out signaling, but little is known about the
   regulation of alpha IIb-mediated outside-in signaling. We show that
   alpha IIb-mediated outside-in signaling is enhanced in platelets of a
   patient lacking the terminal 39 residues of the beta 3 cytoplasmic tall.
   This enhanced signaling was detected as thromboxane A(2) (TxA(2))
   production and granule secretion, and required ligand cross-linking of
   alpha IIb beta 3 and platelet aggregation. This outside-in signaling was
   specifically inhibited by a palmitoylated version of a beta 3 peptide
   corresponding to cytoplasmic domain residues R724-R734. Unlike the
   palmitoylated peptide, the nonpalmitoylated beta 3 peptide could not
   cross the platelet membrane and did not inhibit this outside-in
   signaling. The physiologic relevance of this beta 3-mediated negative
   regulation of alpha IIb outside-in signaling was demonstrated in normal
   platelets treated with the palmitoylated peptide and a physiologic
   agonist. Binding of alpha IIb beta 3 complexes to immobilized peptides
   demonstrated that a peptide corresponding to beta 3 residues R724-R734
   appears to bind to an alpha IIb cytoplasmic domain peptide containing
   residues K989-D1002, but not to control peptides. These results
   demonstrate that alpha IIb-mediated outside-in signaling resulting in
   TxA2 production and granule secretion is negatively regulated by a
   sequence of residues in the membrane distal beta 3 cytoplasmic domain
   sequence RKE-FAKFEEER.

AB Background: Binding of von Willebrand factor (VWF) to the platelet
   membrane glycoprotein (GP) Ib-IX-V complex initiates a cascade of events
   leading to alpha(11b)beta(3) activation and platelet aggregation. The
   roles of ADP and thromboxane A(2) (TXA(2)) in agglutination-induced
   GPIbalpha-mediated platelet activation have not been fully described.
   Methods: Botrocetin and human VWF were used to stimulate washed mouse
   platelets. Platelets deficient in TXA(2) receptors, or
   alpha(11b)beta(3), and inhibitors and chelating agents were used to
   investigate the roles of TXA(2), ADP, alpha(11b)beta(3) and Ca2+ in
   botrocetin/ VWF-induced signaling. Results: Our data demonstrate that
   botrocetin/VWF/GPlbalpha-mediated agglutination results in
   calcium-independent protein kinase C (PKC) and phospholipase A2 (PLA2)
   activities required for GPlbalpha-elicited TXA(2) production that in
   turn causes dense granule secretion. Aggregation of washed platelets
   requires TXA(2)-indLIced alpha(11b)beta(3) activation and ADP signaling.
   TXA(2) or ADP can activate alpha(11b)beta(3), but both are required for
   alpha-granule secretion and aggregation. Botrocefin/VWF-induced dense
   granule secretion is Galphaq-dependent. alpha-Granule secretion requires
   initial ADP signaling through P2Y1 and subsequent signaling through
   P2Y12. Signaling initiated by agglutination is propagated and amplified
   in an alpha(11b)beta(3)-dependent manner. Conclusions: In contrast to
   adhesion or shear stress-induced GPIb-elicited signaling,
   agglutination-elicited GPIb signaling that activates 04103 requires
   TXA(2). Agglutination-elicited TXA(2) production is independent of Ca2+
   influx and mobilization of internal Ca2+ stores. Therefore, our results
   demonstrate that agglutination-elicited GPIb signaling causes
   alpha(11b)beta(3) activation by a mechanism that is distinct from those
   Used by adhesion, or shear stress-induced GPIb signaling.

AB The seven-amino-acid peptide LSARLAF has been reported to activate
   platelets via the integrin GPIIb-IIIa (glycoprotein Ilb-IIIa).
   Activation by LSARLAF is reinforced by release of ADP and thromboxanes.
   but the initiating event in the signalling cascade is not known. In the
   present study, we demonstrate that LSARLAF stimulates Src
   kinase-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of many of the proteins in the
   GPIIb-IIIa cascade, including the tyrosine kinase Syk. the adapter
   SLP-76 (SH2-containing leucocyte phosphoprotein of 76 kDa) and PLCgamma2
   (phospholipase Cgamma2). A critical role for PLCgamma2 in signalling by
   LSARLAF was demonstrated by abolition of aggregation in PLCgamma2-/-
   murine platelets to low concentrations of the peptide, although a
   partial recovery was seen with higher concentrations. In sharp contrast
   with the GPIIb-IIa-regulated signalling cascade, aggregation was
   inhibited in murine platelets deficient in the adapter LAY (linker for
   activation of T-cells) and the Fc receptor gamma-chain. Aggregation was
   also partially inhibited by the cholesterol-lowering reagent,
   beta-methyl-cyclodextrin, at concentrations that disrupt membrane rafts,
   but do not interfere with signalling by GPIIb-IIIa. Furthermore, LSARLAF
   also stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation in GPIIb-deficient murine
   platelets, confirming that the integrin is not critical for activation
   of intracellular signalling pathways. LSARLAF also stimulated Ca2+
   elevation in RBL-2H3 cells, which lack the platelet glycoproteins GPIIb,
   GPVI and GPIb. These results demonstrate that LSARLAF activates
   platelets through a PLCgamma2-dependent pathway that lies downstream of
   Src kinases and which is partially dependent on the Fc receptor
   gamma-chain, LAT and lipid rafts. The mechanism of cell activation by
   LSARLAF remains to be established, although the present results indicate
   that more than one surface glycoprotein may mediate this response.

AB Collagen-induced activation of platelets in suspension leads to

   signaling is required, at least in part, for this TxA2 production and
   ADP secretion. A high level of collagen can activate platelets deficient
   in PLCgamma2, Galphaq, or TxA2 receptors, as well as platelets treated
   with a protein kinase C inhibitor, Ro31-8220. Thus, activation of
   alpha(IIb)beta 3 in response to a high level of collagen does not
   require these signaling proteins. Furthermore, a high level of collagen
   can cause weak TxA2 and ADP-independent aggregation, but maximal
   aggregation induced by a high level of collagen requires TxA2 or
   secretion.

AB The peptide LSARLAF (LSA) causes alphaIIbbeta3-dependent platelet
   activation that results in alpha-granule secretion and aggregation.
   LSARLAF-induced, alphaIIbbeta3-mediated outside-in signaling causing
   alpha-granule secretion and platelet aggregation was studied using
   washed mouse platelets. ADP receptor antagonists, enzyme inhibitors,
   normal platelets and platelets from mice that lack either Galphaq or
   thromboxane (Tx) A2 receptors were used for this investigation. The
   results demonstrate that LSA-induced alphaIIbbeta3-mediated signaling
   producing aggregation of washed platelets is mediated through the
   release of ADP and thromboxane, which cause alpha-granule release by
   mediating their effects though Galphaq and/or Gi depending on the level
   of LSA used to activate the platelets. Specifically, alphaIIbbeta3
   elicited aggregation of washed platelets in response to a low level of
   LSA requires signaling through the ADP receptor P2Y1 and Gaq, and the
   ADP receptor P2Y12 and Gi as well as TxA2 receptors. However, this
   aggregation is independent of Galphaq and TxA2 signaling in response to
   high LSA concentrations, but is dependent on ADP signaling through its
   receptor P2Y12, and therefore presumably Gi, regardless of the level of
   LSA used to activate the platelets. PKC function is required for ADP
   secretion and the subsequent signaling through P2Y12 regardless of the
   level of LSA used to activate the platelets. The end point of the
   LSA-induced alphaIIbbeta3-mediated signaling characterized in this study
   is alpha-granule secretion, which provides the fibrinogen required for
   aggregation of washed platelets.

AB The work presented here demonstrates that platelets from mice lacking
   LAT (linker for the activation of T cells) show reversible aggregation
   in response to concentrations of collagen that cause TxA2/ADP-dependent
   irreversible aggregation of control platelets. The aggregation defect of
   the LAT-deficient platelets was shown to be the result of almost no TxA2
   production and significantly diminished ADP secretion. In contrast, the
   LAT deficiency does not affect aggregation induced by high
   concentrations of collagen because that aggregation is not dependent on
   TxA2 and/or ADP. Even though ADP and TxA2 provide amplification signals
   for platelet activation in response to low concentrations of collagen,
   LAT-deficient platelets hyperaggregate to low levels of U46619, a TxA2
   analog, or ADP. Though the mechanism(s) of costimulatory signals by
   collagen, ADP, and TxA2 remains unidentified, it is clear that LAT plays
   a positive role in collagen-induced, TxA2/ADP-dependent aggregation, and
   a negative role in TxA2 or ADP-induced platelet aggregation. (C) 2002

AB Members of the Src family of kinases are abundant in platelets. Although
   their localization is known, their role(s) in platelet function are not
   well understood. Lyn is a Src-famlly kinase that participates in signal
   transduction pathways elicited by collagen-related peptide; it has also
   been implicated through biochemical studies in the regulation of von
   Willebrand factor signaling. Here, we provide evidence that Lyn plays a
   role in gamma-thrombin activation of platelets. Unlike the wild-type
   platelets, platelets from Lyn-deficient mice do not undergo irreversible
   aggregation, produce thromboxane A2, or secrete adenosine diphosphate in
   response to submaximal gamma-thrombin concentrations that cause
   secretion-dependent irreversible aggregation. Phosphorylation of Akt, a
   downstream effector of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, also requires a
   higher concentration of gamma-thrombin in Lyn-deficient platelets than
   in wild-type platelets. These findings demonstrate that Lyn signaling is
   required for thrombin Induction of secretion-dependent platelet
   aggregation. Specifically, Lyn Is required under these conditions to
   enable thrombin-induced TxA2 production and adenosine diphosphate
   secretion, necessary steps in secretion-dependent platelet aggregation.

AB The peptide LSARLAF causes alpha II beta3-dependent platelet activation
   exemplified by secretion, aggregation, spreading and adhesion on
   fibrinogen, and tyrosine phosphorylation. alpha IIb beta3-dependent
   outside-in signal transduction induced by LSARLAF was investigated in
   variant thrombasthenic platelets which lack most of the cytoplasmic
   domain of the integrin beta3 subunit ((alpha IIb beta3 Delta 724), These
   studies revealed that only certain aspects of this alpha IIb
   beta3-dependent outside-in signaling were affected by the beta3
   truncation. Specifically, alpha IIb beta3 Delta 724 supported
   LSARLAF-induced platelet aggregation, agglutination and secretion, but
   failed to trigger cytoskeletal reorganization and platelet spreading on
   fibrinogen. despite the fact that PMA-induced non alpha IIb beta3
   mediated signaling caused spreading of these platelets on fibrinogen.
   Thus, distinct domains of alpha IIb beta3 are required to support
   different aspects of LSARLAF-induced platelet activation. Furthermore,
   these studies suggest ;that not all alpha IIb beta3-dependent platelet
   responses require an intact beta3 cytoplasmic tail.

AB In vitro assays were used to characterize adhesion of human aortic,
   microvascular and umbilical vein endothelial cells to various forms of
   immobilized fibrinogen. All three types of endothelial cells adhered to
   fibrinogen in a manner that was independent of the A alpha -chain
   572-574 RGD cell binding site. In fact, all three adhered to a fragment
   of the molecule which is composed of only one D domain (D1) of
   fibrinogen. A time course study revealed that extensive adhesion of
   endothelial cells on the ligand coated surface occurred between one and
   two hours incubation. The anti-fibrinogen gammaA-chain monoclonal
   antibody 4A5 as well as 4A5 Fabs, blocked adhesion of endothelial cells
   to fibrinogen, nor vitronectin. The inhibitory effects of 4A5 seemed to
   be indirect because the endothelial cells adhered to the recombinant
   fibrinogen gamma 407 (which lacks the gamma -chain AGDV sequence of the
   carboxyl terminal 4A5 binding site) as well as they did to normal
   recombinant fibrinogen. A recombinant fibrinogen lacking the gamma
   -chain AGDV sequence, containing RGE in place of RGD at the gamma -chain
   572-574 and 95-97 positions, also supported endothelial cell adhesion.
   The anti-alpha (v)beta (3) antibody, LM609, blocked adhesion of
   endothelial cells to fibrinogen. The peptide GRGDSP inhibited
   endothelial cell adhesion on fibrinogen and vitronectin, These results
   demonstrate that alpha (v)beta (3) mediated adhesion (attachment and
   spreading) of HUVECs to fibrinogen may use a site in the D domain of
   fibrinogen and is not dependent on the A alpha -chain RGD (95-97 and
   572-574) sequences, as has been shown in shorter term (where cells were
   rounded) experiments, or the gammaA-chain 408-411 cell binding sites.
   Thus, the data reveal the existence of another unidentified site(s) on
   fibrinogen which can support the irreversible adhesion (attachment and
   spreading) of endothelial cells.

AB The objective of this study was to explore the molecular mechanisms of
   adhesion of endothelial cells (ECs) to implant grades of titanium alloy
   (Ti) and stainless steel (SS), compared to tissue culture polystyrene
   (PS). The idea is that promotion of EC adhesion to implant surfaces
   during the initial stages of healing may be critical in the formation of
   a capillary bed intimately associated with the implant surface.
   Ultimately this could be expected in turn to promote bone formation
   close to the surface and a more stable implant/bone interface. Surfaces
   were coated with either peak 1 fibrinogen gamma A gamma A, fibrinogen Fr
   I-9, fibrinogen fragment D1, fibronectin, vitronectin, or fetal calf
   serum and then post-coated with bovine serum albumin (BSA) to block
   non-specific cell adhesion. Surfaces with BSA alone and no other protein
   coating were also evaluated. Fibronectin coating maximized cell adhesion
   on all three surfaces, and adhesion was highest on PS. BSA blocked cell
   adhesion to PS (and most adhesion to SS) much better than to Ti. These
   results provide evidence that BSA adsorption on the metal surface is
   unable to effectively block the adhesion of the cells to the Ti. These
   data may provide a basis for understanding in vivo observations that
   soft tissue becomes attached to a Ti surface more rapidly and with more
   bone formation than to SS. Evidence is also presented that
   alpha(v)beta(3) plays an important role in adhesion of ECs to the Ti
   surface. These experiments also provide preliminary data which may
   reflect some of the features of initial EC adhesion to metal implants.

AB Decreased expression of functional alpha IIb beta 3 complexes on the
   platelet surface produces Glanzmann thrombasthenia, We have identified
   mutations of alpha IIb(P145) in 3 ethnically distinct families affected
   by Glanzmann thrombasthenia, Affected Mennonite and Dutch patients were
   homozygous and doubly heterozygous, respectively, for a P(145)A
   substitution, whereas a Chinese patient was doubly heterozygous for a
   (PL)-L-145 substitution. The mutations affect expression levels of
   surface alpha IIb beta 3 receptors on their platelets, which was
   confirmed by co-transfection of alpha IIb(P145A) and beta 3 cDNA
   constructs in COS-1 cells. Each mutation also impaired the ability of
   alpha IIb beta 3 on affected platelets to interact with ligands.
   Moreover, when alpha IIb(P145A) and beta 3 were stably coexpressed in
   Chinese hamster ovary cells, alpha IIb beta 3 was readily detected on
   the cell surface, but the cells were unable to adhere to immobilized
   fibrinogen or to bind soluble fluorescein isothiocyanate-fibrinogen
   after alpha IIb beta 3 activation by the activating monoclonal antibody
   PT25-2, Nonetheless, incubating affected platelets with the peptide
   LSARLAF, which binds to alpha IIb, induced PF4 secretion, indicating
   that the mutant alpha IIb beta 3 retained the ability to mediate
   outside-in signaling. These studies indicate that mutations involving
   alpha IIb(P145) impair surface expression of alpha IIb beta 3 and that
   the alpha IIb(P145A) mutation abrogates ligand binding to the activated
   integrin, A comparative analysis of other alpha IIb mutations with a
   similar phenotype suggests that these mutations may cluster into a
   single region on the surface of the alpha IIb and may define a domain
   influencing ligand binding. (C) 2000 by The American Society of

AB Adhesion of resting platelets to fibrinogen was enhanced by a peptide
   which was designed to bind near the presumptive fibrinogen gamma-chain
   binding site of the alpha subunit of the integrin alpha(IIb)beta(3).
   This peptide, but not a scrambled control peptide, induced adhesion of
   resting platelets to fibronectin, vitronectin, von Willebrand factor,
   and monovalent (lacks one functional gamma-chain) fibrinogen. Resting
   platelets not treated with the agonist peptide did not adhere to these
   ligands. Agonist peptide induced adhesion of resting platelets to Fg was
   not secretion dependent and was inhibited by the monoclonal antibody
   7E3. The agonist peptide caused aggregation of resting platelets on
   resting platelets adherent to immobilized Fg without causing platelet
   shape change. Therefore, the agonist peptide may activate
   alpha(IIb)beta(3) by directly inducing a conformation change in the
   receptor on resting platelets. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB In this study, endothelial cell-mediated clot retraction was supported
   by fibrin generated from several purified fractions of plasma
   fibrinogen, purified proteolytic fragments of plasma fibrinogen,
   recombinant normal fibrinogen, and recombinant variant fibrinogen, These
   results were surprising because some of these fibrinogens lack domains
   that are known binding sites for the integrin receptors that support
   clot retraction. Specifically, fibrinogens lacking A alpha-chain RGD
   residues at 572-574 or lacking the gamma-chain residues AGDV 408-411
   supported endothelial cell-mediated clot retraction as well as intact
   fibrinogen, Thus, clot retraction mediated by endothelial cells is not
   dependent on either of these sites, A variety of monoclonal antibodies
   against the integrin alpha(v) beta(3) partially inhibited the
   endothelial cell-mediated retraction of clots formed from plasma
   fibrinogen, As expected, an antibody to the platelet integrin
   alpha(IIb)beta(3) did not inhibit endothelial cell-mediated clot
   retraction. These results indicate that this retraction is mediated at
   least in part by alpha(v) beta(3). These results support the conclusion
   that (a) neither of the two fibrinogen cell binding sites described
   above is required to support clot retraction or that (b) either site
   alone or in conjunction with other fibrin(ogen) region(s) can support
   clot retraction, Thus, endothelial cell-mediated clot retraction appears
   to be dependent on fibrinogen cell binding sites other than those
   required to support adhesion of resting platelets to immobilized
   fibrinogen and platelet aggregation.

AB A novel peptide (designed to bind to alpha(IIb)beta(3)) caused platelet
   aggregation and aggregation-independent secretion of the contents of
   alpha-granules in an alpha(IIb)beta(3)-dependent fashion. The agonist
   peptide induced secretion in the presence of prostaglandin E-1. In
   cell-free assays, alpha(IIb)beta(3) bound specifically to immobilized
   agonist peptide and the peptide enhanced the binding of fibrinogen to
   immobilized alpha(IIb)beta(3). The agonist peptide apparently activates
   alpha(IIb)beta(3) by directly inducing a conformational change in the
   receptor. This change activates the platelets and causes secretion in a
   manner independent of fibrinogen binding.

AB A novel inhibitor of human platelet aggregation, named variabilin, was
   isolated from salivary glands of the hard tick Dermacentor variabilis
   using a combination of gel filtration and high pressure liquid
   chromatography, Variabilin was a potent antagonist of the fibrinogen
   receptor glycoprotein IIb-IIIa (GPIIb-IIIa; alpha(IIb)beta(3)) and the
   vitronectin receptor alpha(v) beta(3). Amino acid sequence analysis by
   Edman degradation revealed that it has 47 residues, with a molecular
   weight of 4968.5. Like many other naturally occurring antagonists of
   GPIIb-IIIa, variabilin contains the RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) motif. However,
   unlike the RGD-containing antagonists of GPIIb-IIIa, the RGD sequence of
   variabilin is not positioned in a loop bracketed by cysteine residues,
   It has little sequence homology to the other known naturally occurring
   antagonists of GPIIb-IIIa, including the disintegrins from snakes,
   decorsin and ornatin from leeches, and disagregin from soft ticks.
   Variabilin is the first RGD containing antagonist isolated from ticks.

AB Gastrulation is characterized by dramatic cell migration which is
   thought to require the interaction of cell adhesion molecules with
   extracellular molecules. We have tested two novel peptides, a
   fibronectin peptide and a fibronectin receptor peptide, for their
   effects on gastrulation of the leopard frog Rana pipiens. The
   fibronectin peptide DRVPHSRNSIT corresponds to residues 1373-1383 of the
   cell-binding domain of fibronectin; the receptor peptide DLYYLMDL
   corresponds to residues 124-131 of beta 1 subunit of a variety of
   integrins including alpha 5 beta 1. Either of these peptides
   significantly inhibited gastrulation after being microinjected into
   mid-blastulae. These results indicate that these sequences may
   correspond to the ligand/receptor interaction sites of fibronectin and
   its receptor(s).

AB Platelet adhesion to various forms of fibrinogen was studied using
   platelets in plasma and washed platelets. The study was designed to
   determine if platelets prepared with minimal handling in plasma at
   physiological pH containing normal levels of Ca2+ have different
   requirements for adhesion to immobilized fibrinogen than do washed
   platelets tested in the absence of plasma. Exposure of platelets to
   citrate and low pH did not seem to affect the requirements of washed
   platelets for adhesion to fibrinogen. Nonetheless, behavioural
   differences between these two types of platelets were seen.
   Surprisingly, in the absence of exogenous activation normal platelets in
   plasma behaved qualitatively as stimulated washed platelets. That is,
   both types of platelets adhered to all forms of fibrinogen which
   possessed at least one gamma-chain carboxyl terminal platelet binding
   site. Platelets in plasma treated with prostaglandin E(1) (resting
   platelets) adhered only to forms of fibrinogen which contained two
   gamma-chain platelet binding sites. These observations also demonstrate
   that the fibrinogen alpha-chain arginine-glycine-aspartic
   acid-phenylalanine and arginine-glycine-aspartic acid-serine sequences
   are not necessary or sufficient to mediate the adhesion of resting or
   stimulated platelets in plasma to fibrinogen. The presence of endogenous
   adenosine diphosphate appears to account, at least in part, for the
   ability of normal platelets in plasma to adhere to forms of fibrinogen
   which have only one gamma-chain platelet binding site.

AB We previously reported that a peptide with the sequence Gly-Ala-Pro-Leu
   (GAPL) found as residues 309-312 in glycoprotein IIb(alpha) (GPIIb)
   comprises at least part of a Fg binding site on GPIIb (1). Subsequent
   studies demonstrated that a peptide corresponding to residues 300-312 of
   GPIIb(alpha) can bind to Fg and Vn, and is a potent inhibitor of
   platelet aggregation and the adhesion of activated platelets to at least
   four adhesive ligands: Fg, Fn, Vn, and vWf (2). Here, the production and
   initial characterization of polyclonal antibodies against this peptide
   are described. ELISAs and dot-blot assays reveal the specificity of the
   antibodies for the peptide immunogen. In immunoblots, the antibodies
   recognize GPIIb under reducing conditions. The binding of Fg to
   immobilized GPIIb/IIIa, the rate of clot retraction and the adhesion of
   stimulated platelets to Fg, fibronectin (Fn), vitronectin (Vn), and von
   Willebrand factor (vWf) were inhibited by these antibodies, but not by a
   control IgG. These results together with our earlier published data
   indicate that GPIIb(alpha) (300-312) comprises at least part of a common
   ligand binding site within the integrin alpha(IIb) subunit.

AB Adhesion of resting and stimulated platelets to immobilized fibrinogen
   (Fg) was characterized using various forms of Fg, receptor peptide
   mimics, and antibodies to glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa and Fg. Resting
   platelets adhered to Fg, but to less than half the extent of the same
   platelets stimulated with epinephrine/ADP. The adhesion of resting and
   stimulated platelets to Fg was inhibited by a receptor peptide mimic
   (G13, a peptide corresponding to residues 300-312 of GPIIb),
   anti-GPIIb/IIIa antibodies, and a monoclonal antibody (4A5) against the
   carboxyl terminus of the gamma chain of Fg. The results presented here
   demonstrate that the alpha chain RGD platelet recognition sites are not
   required to mediate the adhesion of either stimulated or resting
   platelets to immobilized Fg. Although stimulated platelets can adhere
   extensively to monomeric Fg containing one functional gamma chain,
   resting platelets require bivalent Fg containing two functional gamma
   chains to mediate irreversible adhesion to Fg.

AB The platelet fibrinogen (Fg) receptor (GPIIb/IIIa) is an integrin which
   plays a critical role in hemostasis by recognizing at least the four
   adhesive ligands: Fg, fibronectin (Fn), vitronectin (Vn), and von
   Willebrand factor (vWf). We reported that residues 309-312 of
   GPIIb(alpha) appear to comprise at least part of a Fg binding site on
   the Fg receptor (Gartner, T. K., and Taylor, D. B. (1990) Thromb. Res.
   60, 291-309). Here we report that the peptide GPIIb(alpha) 300-312 (G13)
   inhibits platelet aggregation and binds Fg and Vn. Significantly, this
   peptide inhibits the adhesion of stimulated platelets to Fg, Fn, Vn, and
   vWf, but not the adhesion of resting platelets to Fn. Thus, GPIIb
   300-312 may constitute a specific but common recognition site on
   GPIIb/IIIa for both LGGAKQAGDV- and RGD-containing ligands.

AB The effects of extracellular sodium on platelet aggregation and calcium

   mobilization in response to all levels of RSL tested.  In contrast
   platelet aggregation was sodium-dependent in response to
   less-than-or-equal-to .2 units/ml alpha-thrombin.  Surprisingly, calcium
   mobilization occurred in platelets treated with a threshold level of
   alpha-thrombin in the absence of external sodium.  Thus sodium-dependent
   platelet aggregation in response to a low dose of thrombin apparently is
   not the result of sodium-dependent calcium mobilization.

AB Antiplatelet agents are clinically useful as antithrombotic entities.
   The importance of antiplatelet agents led us to design, synthesize, and
   characterize a new antiplatelet peptide. This peptide is a presumptive
   mimic of a ligand binding site on the platelet fibrinogen receptor.
   Unlike peptides related to Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser and
   His-His-Leu-Gly-Gly-Ala-Lys-Gln-Ala-Gly-Asp-Val that bind to the
   fibrinogen receptor, this peptide binds to fibrinogen. The
   anticomplementarity hypothesis was used to design this presumptive
   peptide mimic of the vitronectin binding site on the fibrinogen
   receptor, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa complexes. The resulting peptide
   (Glu-His-Ile-Pro-Ala) has the characteristics of a fibrinogen binding
   site mimic: It binds fibrinogen and inhibits both the adhesion of
   platelets to fibrinogen and platelet aggregation. The peptide also
   inhibits the adhesion of platelets to vitronectin. The antiplatelet
   activity of this mimic peptide was dependent on its amino acid sequence,
   since closely related analogues were either inactive or less active
   inhibitors of platelet function than the original peptide. These results
   demonstrate that the peptide Glu-His-Ile-Pro-Ala has the characteristics
   expected of a mimic of a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa ligand binding site.
