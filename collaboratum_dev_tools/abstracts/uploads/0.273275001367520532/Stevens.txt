AB The effects of gallic acid, methyl gallate, propyl gallate and tannic
   acid on cell growth, protein synthesis, photosynthesis, membrane
   function and metabolic activity of Nostoc sp. strain MAC were
   quantitatively investigated. Treatment of MAC with 1/2 inhibitory
   concentrations of tannic acid and related compounds resulted in a severe
   decline in biological production. Chlorophyll a and c-phycocyanin
   syntheses were inhibited by over 90%. Glutamine synthetase and nitrate
   reductase activities were suppressed by at least 45% and 56%,
   respectively. The percentage inhibition of total cell yield was around
   40%, whereas that of total protein was around 80%. In addition, cellular
   potassium loss was 2-5 times that of control cultures and was
   accompanied by a loss in phosphate of about 1.2 times that of control
   cultures. However, gallic acid did not inhibit c-phycocyanin synthesis,
   nor did tannic acid or propyl gallate inhibit the activity of glutamine
   synthetase. Methyl gallate had no effect on electrolyte efflux. The
   control of biomass accumulation in relation to the production of
   off-flavor compounds in cyanobacteria by natural tannin compounds may
   have important aquacultural implications.

AB Spontaneous mutants of the cyanobacterium Synechococcus PCC 7002
   resistant to chlorate were isolated. Either 40 mM or 400 mM Na2ClO3 was
   used as the selective agent. Putative Chl(r) colonies were picked onto
   medium containing ammonia as the sole N source, then replica-plated to
   media containing either NH4+, NO2-, or NO3- as N sources. Of 252
   putative mutants, 106 were able to use either NH4Cl or NaNO2 but not
   NaNO3 as their sole source of nitrogen. All of the mutant isolates had
   generation times similar to wild-type 7002 when grown on either ammonium
   (3.8-4.1 h/generation) or nitrite (4.5-4.7 h/generation). None had
   detectable methyl viologen-supported nitrate reductase activity and are
   thus phenotypically NRase(-). The Chl(r) mutants had photomediated O-2
   production and dark O-2 uptake rates similar to the wild type and
   responded similarly to selected metabolic inhibitors. They expressed
   increased levels of phycocyanin (PC) synthesis under normal,
   nitrogen-replete growth conditions, but rapidly lapsed into a chlorotic
   state upon a shift to either medium containing nitrate or to N-free
   medium. Genetic analysis of the Chl(r) mutants indicated that each could
   be rescued by direct transformation with chromosomally derived DNA from
   the wild-type strain. Frequencies of transformation for the mutants were
   characteristic for single genetic lesions in this cyanobacterium. On the
   basis of marker rescue by a cosmid library of wild-type DNA, the
   NRase(-) mutants could be grouped into five distinctive genotypic
   families.

AB Larvae of the mosquito Aedes aegypti ingested, and developed into
   adults, on a diet of 10 of 14 different species of cyanobacteria
   including Agmenellum quadruplicatum PR-6 (= Synechococcus PCC7002).
   Mosquito larvae ingested and grew on cells of PR-6 adapted to growth in
   the absence of NaCl. The cryIVD gene of Bacillus thuringiensis var.
   israelensis was cloned into a PR-6 expression vector to form pAQRM56,
   which was transformed into PR-6. Expression of the CryIVD protein in
   PR-6 was demonstrated by immunocytochemistry and larvicidal activity.
   Immunogold labelling indicated production of an electron-dense material
   among the thylakoid membranes of PR-6. Cells of PR-6 carrying pAQRM56
   were toxic to the larvae of A. aeqypti whereas control cells were not.
   Growth of PR-6 cells carrying pAQRM56 was slower than the growth of
   control cells and these cells were also larger.

AB We investigated the possibility of eliciting a measurable photoinduced
   electrical current from the cyanobacterium Agmenellum quadruplicatum
   PR-6 (Synechococcus PCC 7002). This proved virtually impossible for
   intact cells. However, treated PR-6 cells fixed in an alginate matrix on
   tin oxide as the active electrode in a three electrode electrochemical
   cell gave rise to a significant light response. Cell treatments
   involving toluene, chloroform or detergents were effective and gave
   current responses up to 250 nA. Drying the cyanobacterial matrix
   increased the current yield at least fifty-fold. These effects were
   observed for light wavelengths > 650 nm and were not influenced by
   inhibitors or enhancers of photosynthesis nor by sustained argon
   bubbling of the electrolyte.
   French pressure cell lysates facilitated distinction between two light
   induced current components. Lysates prepared without CaCl2 gave current
   induction kinetics that were indistinguishable from those on chemically
   treated cells i.e. slowly rising to a stable maximum in 10-15 min. When
   CaCl2 was present during lysis, a rapidly induced (< 1 s) unstable
   component was observed. Toluenization of PR-6 either prior to or post
   lysing abolished the CaCl2 related effect. CaCl2 had no effect on
   current induction in strain PR-6008, which lacked the alpha and beta
   subunits of phycocyanin and exhibited slow current induction kinetics.
   The observed effects are interpreted as responses of components of the
   photosystems of PR-6 rather than in terms of an integrated
   photosynthetic process.

AB A mosquitocidal cyanobacterium has been developed by introducing the
   mosquito-toxic cryIVD gene from Bacillus thuringiensis subsp.
   israelensis into the unicellular cyanobacterium Agmenellum
   quadruplicatum PR-6 (Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7002). The cryIVD gene
   was introduced into the cyanobacterium on a derivative of the PR-6
   expression vector pAQE19-DELTA-Sal in which the cryIVD gene was
   translationally fused to the initial coding sequence of the highly
   expressed PR-6 cpcB gene. Coomassie blue staining and immunoblot
   analysis of gel-fractionated cell extract polypeptides indicate that the
   cpcB-cryIVD gene fusion is expressed at high levels in the
   cyanobacterial cells, with little or no apparent degradation of the
   cryIVD gene product. Larvicidal assays revealed that freshly hatched
   Culex pipiens mosquito larvae readily ingested the transformed
   cyanobacteria and that the cells proved to be toxic to the larvae.
