AB The phylogeny of insects, one of the most spectacular radiations of life
   on earth, has received considerable attention [1-3]. However, the
   evolutionary roots of one intriguing group of insects, the twisted-wing
   parasites (Strepsiptera), remain unclear despite centuries of study and
   debate [1, 2, 4-11]. Strepsiptera exhibit exceptional larval
   developmental features, consistent with a predicted step from direct
   (hemimetabolous) larval development to complete metamorphosis that could
   have set the stage for the spectacular radiation of metamorphic
   (holometabolous) insects [1, 12, 13]. Here we report the sequencing of a
   Strepsiptera genome and show that the analysis of sequence-based genomic
   data (comprising more than 18 million nucleotides from nearly 4,500
   genes obtained from a total of 13 insect genomes), along with genomic
   metacharacters, clarifies the phylogenetic origin of Strepsiptera and
   sheds light on the evolution of holometabolous insect development. Our
   results provide overwhelming support for Strepsiptera as the closest
   living relatives of beetles (Coleoptera). They demonstrate that the
   larval developmental features of Strepsiptera, reminiscent of those of
   hemimetabolous insects, are the result of convergence. Our analyses
   solve the long-standing enigma of the evolutionary roots of Strepsiptera
   and reveal that the holometabolous mode of insect development is more
   malleable than previously thought.

AB Most molecular phylogenetic studies of beetles (order Coleoptera) using
   18S rDNA have recovered the suborders Adephaga and Polyphaga as sister
   groups, together sister to the suborders Myxophaga and Archostemata,
   with Archostemata alone or in combination with Myxophaga as the closest
   relative of all other beetles. Analyses of data from other genes have
   recovered alternative arrangements. Estimated subordinal divergence
   times based on analyses of DNA sequence data and fossil calibrations
   range from similar to 285-266 million years ago (Ma), with most extant
   families estimated to have originated in the Jurassic. However, timing
   and patterns of ecological and taxonomic diversification remain
   uncertain for most beetle groups primarily due to limited gene and
   nucleotide sampling, missing data, and a corresponding lack of
   well-supported resolution. Consequently, the nature and degree to which
   events in earth's history (e.g., the diversification and rise of
   angiosperms to ecological dominance) have influenced the success of
   Coleoptera remains unclear. Nevertheless, the phylogeny of beetles is
   being revealed via molecular studies with large taxon and gene samples,
   presenting renewed and novel opportunities for the study of beetle
   macroevolution.

AB Background: The extraordinary morphology, reproductive and developmental
   biology, and behavioral ecology of twisted wing parasites (order
   Strepsiptera) have puzzled biologists for centuries. Even today, the
   phylogenetic position of these enigmatic "insects from outer space'' [1]
   remains uncertain and contentious. Recent authors have argued for the
   placement of Strepsiptera within or as a close relative of beetles
   (order Coleoptera), as sister group of flies (order Diptera), or even
   outside of Holometabola.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Here, we combine data from several
   recent studies with new data (for a total of 9 nuclear genes and similar
   to 13 kb of aligned data for 34 taxa), to help clarify the phylogenetic
   placement of Strepsiptera. Our results unequivocally support the
   monophyly of Neuropteroidea (= Neuropterida + Coleoptera) +
   Strepsiptera, but recover Strepsiptera either derived from within
   polyphagan beetles (order Coleoptera), or in a position sister to
   Neuropterida. All other supra-ordinal- and ordinal-level relationships
   recovered with strong nodal support were consistent with most other
   recent studies.
   Conclusions/Significance: These results, coupled with the recent
   proposed placement of Strepsiptera sister to Coleoptera, suggest that
   while the phylogenetic neighborhood of Strepsiptera has been identified,
   unequivocal placement to a specific branch within Neuropteroidea will
   require additional study.

AB The extraordinary diversity of herbivorous beetles is usually attributed
   to coevolution with angiosperms. However, the degree and nature of
   contemporaneity in beetle and angiosperm diversification remain unclear.
   Here we present a large-scale molecular phylogeny for weevils
   (herbivorous beetles in the superfamily Curculionoidea), one of the most
   diverse lineages of insects, based on approximate to 8 kilobases of DNA
   sequence data from a worldwide sample including all families and
   subfamilies. Estimated divergence times derived from the combined
   molecular and fossil data indicate diversification into most families
   occurred on gymnosperms in the Jurassic, beginning approximate to 166
   Ma. Subsequent colonization of early crown-group angiosperms occurred
   during the Early Cretaceous, but this alone evidently did not lead to an
   immediate and major diversification event in weevils. Comparative trends
   in weevil diversification and angiosperm dominance reveal that massive
   diversification began in the mid-Cretaceous (ca. 112.0 to 93.5 Ma), when
   angiosperms first rose to widespread floristic dominance. These and
   other evidence suggest a deep and complex history of coevolution between
   weevils and angiosperms, including codiversification, resource tracking,
   and sequential evolution.

AB The high extant species diversity of tropical lineages of organisms is
   usually portrayed as a relatively recent and rapid development or as a
   consequence of the gradual accumulation or preservation of species over
   time. These explanations have led to alternative views of tropical
   forests as evolutionary "cradles" or "museums" of diversity, depending
   on the organisms under study. However, biogeographic and fossil evidence
   implies that the evolutionary histories of diversification among
   tropical organisms may be expected to exhibit characteristics of both
   cradle and museum models. This possibility has not been explored in
   detail for any group of terrestrial tropical organisms. From an
   extensively sampled molecular phylogeny of herbivorous Neotropical leaf
   beetles in the genus Cephaloleia, we present evidence for (i)
   comparatively ancient Paleocene-Eocene adaptive radiation associated
   with global warming and Cenozoic maximum global temperatures, (it)
   moderately ancient lineage-specific diversification coincident with the
   Oligocene adaptive radiation of Cephaloleia host plants in the genus
   Heliconia, and (iii) relatively recent Miocene-Pliocene diversification
   coincident with the collision of the Panama arc with South America and
   subsequent bridging of the Isthmus of Panama. These results demonstrate
   that, for Cephaloleia and perhaps other lineages of organisms, tropical
   forests are at the same time both evolutionary cradles and museums of
   diversity.

AB Monodominant forests are a widespread feature of the humid and wet
   lowland tropics, but little is known about their origins or factors
   mediating their persistence. Nonetheless, escape from significant
   vertebrate and invertebrate seed predation plays a prominent role in
   most hypotheses. The seeds of Pentaclethra macroloba (Fabaceae:
   Mimosoideae) have long been thought to be virtually immune to predation,
   contributing to its local dominance in the canopy of some Mesoamerican
   forests. Here, we describe herbivory by the larvae of Carmenta
   surinamensis (Lepidoptera: Sesiidae) on the seeds of P. macroloba, and
   report the results of studies designed to clarify how this interaction
   influences germination, seedling growth, and mortality. To this end, we
   collected P. macroloba seeds at 30-d intervals for 5 mo along a rain
   forest transect in Costa Rica. The seeds were monitored in a shade house
   for 30 d. Adult moths were reared from 43.6 percent of seeds, and
   significantly affected germination and mortality, and all measures of
   growth (number of leaves, seedling height, seed and seedling mass at 30
   d, and 30-d change in seed and seedling mass). Based on these
   observations, we conclude that seed boring by C. surinamensis is a
   potentially important factor influencing population dynamics in P.
   macroloba, and warrants further investigation for its prospective role
   in regulating local abundance in this locally dominant and ecologically
   significant tree.

   host plant taxon and tissue use among species. Our study is based on up
   to 2088 bp of mtDNA sequence data. Maximum parsimony, maximum
   likelihood, and Bayesian methods of phylogenetic inference consistently
   recover a monophyletic Cephaloleia outside of a basal clade of primarily
   palm feeding species (the 'Arecaceae-feeding clade'), and C irregularis.
   In all three analyses, the 'Arecaceae-feeding clade' includes
   Cephaloleia spp. with unusual morphological features, and a few species
   currently placed in other cassidine genera and tribes. All three
   analyses also recover a clade that includes all Zingiberales feeding
   Cephaloleia and most Cephaloleia species (the 'Zingiberales-feeding
   clade'). Two notable clades are found within the 'Zingiberales-feeding
   clade.' One is comprised of beetles that normally feed only on the young
   rolled leaves of plants in the families Heliconiaceae and Marantaceae
   (the 'Heliconiaceae & Marantaceae-feeding clade'). The other is
   comprised of relative host tissue generalist, primarily Zingiberales
   feeding species (the 'generalist-feeding clade'). A few species in the
   'generalist-feeding clade' utilize Cyperaceae or Poaceae as hosts.
   Overall, relatively basal Cephaloleia (e.g., the "Arecaceae clade') feed
   on relatively basal monocots (e.g., Cyclanthaceae and Arecaceae), and
   relatively derived Cephaloleia (e.g., the 'Zingiberales-feeding clade')
   feed on relatively derived monocots (mostly in the order Zingiberales).
   Zingiberales feeding and specialization on young rolled Zingiberales
   leaves have each apparently evolved just once in Cephaloleia. (c) 2005

AB Depressaria Haworth is a relatively species-rich group of moths with a
   Holarctic distribution. In western North America there has been a
   striking radiation of Apiaceae-feeding members of the genus. To
   understand patterns of Depressaria distribution, host usage, and natural
   history in the western United States, we surveyed select potential host
   plants for larvae. Particular emphasis was placed on surveying plants in
   the genus Lomatium Raf. because most published Depressaria host plant
   records are from this genus. Surveys took place throughout the western
   United States from Utah and Wyoming to the Pacific Ocean, and from the
   Canadian border in Washington State to California and northern Arizona.
   Approximately 32,000 km of roadway were covered. When larvae were
   encountered they were collected and reared to adulthood. Ten species of
   Depressaria were reared. Two additional potentially undescribed species,
   represented only by female specimens, were also reared. Our data support
   previously published accounts of Depressaria biology, host usage, and
   distribution, consistent with the fact that known host plant genera were
   targeted in the surveys. Substantial changes in land use have occurred
   in some parts of the western United States since the work of J. F. G.
   Clarke, an early student of Depressaria. Several of his published
   collection localities, including the type locality for D. whitmani
   Clarke and most collection localities near the Pacific Coast and in dry
   grasslands, have been destroyed or seriously degraded by agriculture,
   grazing, roadway improvements, and other forms of development.

AB We conducted this study to investigate the magnitude of roadway
   mortality of Lepidoptera in central Illinois. To quantify the number and
   kinds of Lepidoptera killed along roadways, dead adult Lepidoptera were
   collected, identified, and counted from along 13 roadside transects in
   the vicinity of Champaign/Urbana, Illinois, with collections occurring
   weekly on each transect for six weeks. During the six weeks of this
   study, 1824 presumably road-killed Lepidoptera were collected. At
   traffic rates of 1000, 13,500 and 19,700 vehicles per day, more
   Lepidoptera were collected per 100 m than at other traffic rates. A peak
   in monarch butterfly mortality may coincide with the timing of their
   annual migration through the area. Based on these data, the number of
   Lepidoptera killed along roadways for the entire state of Illinois
   during one week was estimated at more than 20,000,000 individuals. The
   number of monarch butterflies killed may have exceeded 500,000
   individuals. Our results suggest that increases in traffic rate and
   speed limit may to a certain extent increase mortality.
