AB Use of habitat is a critical component related to structure of
   small-mammal communities, with partitioning occurring primarily along
   dimensions of microhabitat, although use of microhabitat often does not
   explain fully use at a macrohabitat level. Through grid studies of small
   mammals in coastal Colima, Mexico (during January 2003-2005), we
   appraised influence of available habitat, species richness, abundance,
   and cumulative abundance of other small mammals on variation in habitat
   used by species. We evaluated 14 habitat variables (reflecting ground
   cover, slope, canopy, and vegetation density on vertical and horizontal
   axes) and developed a composite variable (principal component 1)
   reflecting general openness of habitat through which we addressed
   habitat use. For the four most common mammalian species (Sigmodon
   mascotensis, Heteromys pictus, Baiomys musculus, and Oryzomys couesi),
   two measures of variation in habitat used were employed to estimate
   niche breadth, one of which assessed variation in habitat use relative
   to variation present on a grid. Sigmodon mascotensis and B. musculus
   preferred areas that were more open, and H. pictus and O. couesi
   occupied less-open areas; breadth of habitat use did not differ
   interspecifically. Habitat use was more variable on grids with more
   variability in habitat, although not greater than chance expectations.
   Findings do not lend support to the resource-breadth hypothesis as an
   explanation for population densities of species at a local level or the
   habitat-heterogeneity hypothesis as a predictor of species richness.
   Variation in habitat used by S. mascotensis did not proportionally
   increase when diverse habitat was available but was greater when the
   species was more abundant. For H. pictus, when cumulative abundance of
   other small mammals was greater, breadth of habitat used was greater.
   Intraspecific density-dependent habitat selection may result in S.
   mascotensis selecting a greater variety of habitats, while greater
   interspecific abundance is related to a greater range in use of habitats
   by H. pictus. Baiomys musculus used a higher proportion of habitat
   relative to that available when more species were present on a grid.
   Variation in habitat used by O. couesi was unrelated to any factor
   examined. Overall, the four species responded in notably different ways
   with respect to availability of habitat, abundance, and presence of
   other species. (c) 2012 Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Saugetierkunde.

AB Species co-occurrence is an important ecological research area.
   Mark-and-recapture studies of mammals allow identification of coexisting
   species, a necessary step in determining mechanisms enabling habitat
   sharing. Using data from five 1-ha grids in January 2004 in tropical dry
   deciduous forest of coastal Colima. Mexico, we detected significantly
   more interspecific overlap than expected between seven species pairs.
   Oryzomys couesi shared more stations than expected with Sigmodon
   mascotensis, Baiomys musculus and Peromyscus perfulvus. Baiomys musculus
   was associated positively with S. mascotensis and Reithrodontomys
   fulvescens. Heteromys pictus shared fewer stations than expected with O.
   couesi and S. mascotensis. For species collectively, there was
   non-random community structuring, with two grids displaying more species
   aggregation than expected. While two grids had non-random co-occurrence
   patterns, three grids did not differ from random, which differs from
   that reported for mammalian taxa on average. Other small-mammal studies
   have documented species segregation, while this study detected more
   positive than negative associations. Similarities in preference and
   habitat use (or diet) are likely explanations for interspecific overlap
   patterns at stations and co-occurrence patterns among grids.
   Simultaneously evaluating associations of species pairs and all species
   on a grid collectively is novel methodology as applied to mammals,
   adding to understanding of species co-occurrence.

AB Temporal partitioning in foraging patterns of syntopic Virginia opossums
   (Didelphis virginiana) and raccoons (Procyon lotor) was investigated at
   3 sites in western Tennessee through the use of timers attached to live
   traps on trapping grids and through time-stamped remote photography
   using infrared-triggered cameras at bait stations. Data were analyzed
   using Watson's U(2)-test, chi-square analyses, and probability tests.
   Results revealed no intraspecific differences in time of foraging for
   either species and a lack of interspecific differentiation. A high
   degree of overlap in foraging times of the species was observed.
   Virginia opossums and raccoons apparently did not partition their times
   of foraging. Foraging patterns of each species seem to be independent of
   the other (neutral association).

   (January 2003-2005), evaluating habitat preferences and demography.
   Yearly we established five grids with 100 trapping stations (one ground
   and one elevated trap; 24,000 trap-nights), each evaluated for 14
   environmental measures. We captured 96 S. mascotensis 274 times on 10
   grids, most at ground level (85.6%), with densities of 0.84-25.31
   individuals/ha. Adults predominated (88.2%), sex ratio (males: females)
   was 1:0.74, and males were heavier. Sigmodon mascotensis co-occurred
   with Oryzomys couesi and Baiomys musculus more often and Heteromys
   pictus less often than chance expectation. For 2004, univariate analyses
   indicated that stations frequented had more ground cover in woody
   plants, forbs and grasses; less in litter and bare ground; more
   vegetation low and less high; lower and more open canopy; and longer
   distance to nearest tree. Logistic regression indicated preference for
   open canopy, dense low vegetation, little litter and longer distance to
   nearest tree. Nonparametric multiplicative regression showed occurrence
   likelihood decreased as litter increased and increased with increasing
   slope, average hits at 1 m and average distance to nearest tree. The
   likelihood was high with no or low canopy, as well as high canopy.

AB Most surveys for bats are conducted using mist nets in riparian areas
   along stream corridors. Various methods exist for deploying mist nets,
   but success of using different configurations has not been assessed. We
   tested efficiency of three configurations of mist nets during summers of
   2000 and 2001 at the Milan Army Ammunition Plant (Carroll and Gibson
   counties) in western Tennessee. Configurations of mist nets included: I
   (one net placed transverse to stream), T (one net placed transverse to
   stream, and one net positioned perpendicular to first net in midstream),
   and Z (two nets positioned parallel to stream, and a center net
   positioned diagonally between the two nets). The study consisted of 347
   net nights and 220 captures of bats (85 I, 62 T, 73 Z). Four species
   were captured including: 133 Lasiurus borealis, 63 Perimyotis subflavus,
   15 Nycticeius humeralis, and nine Myotis austroriparius. Sex-ratios for
   adults were female biased, while juvenile sex-ratios were near equal.
   Netting results suggest that traditional I-configurations were
   statistically equal to T- and Z-configurations for all analyses of total
   captures and for the two dominant species captured: L. borealis and P
   subflavus. Because the I-configuration requires less equipment and time
   for set-up, capturing bats in linear corridors could be optimized by
   using more I-nets rather than multiple net configurations.

AB The vesper rat (Nyctomys sumichrasti), a little-known arboreal rodent,
   was encountered during mark-recapture studies in Colima, Mexico, in
   January 2003-2007. We trapped on the Pacific coast at Playa de Oro
   (2003-2005) and in northern Colima (2006-2007). Each year five trap
   grids were established in heavily vegetated areas and typically run for
   8 nights (100 trap stations per grid, each station with a ground trap
   and an arboreal trap elevated 1-2 m, 10 x 10 configuration with adjacent
   stations 10 m apart; 1,600 trap-nights per grid; 40,000 trap-nights
   total). Nyctomys sumichrasti occurs throughout most of Colima. On grids
   we captured 29 individuals a total of 41 times, with 90.2% of captures
   in arboreal traps and 69.0% of animals being adults. The sex ratio of
   adults was 1.22:1 (males:females), not statistically different from 1:1.
   Most adult females (77.8%) were pregnant or lactating. Mean mass was
   41.3 and 38.6 g for males and females, respectively (P>0.05). Mean
   greatest distances traveled were longer for males (60.6 m) than females
   (20.2 m), with an overall mean of 40.4 m. One to six individuals were
   captured on 9 of 25 grids, with density estimates of 0.87-4.09/ha. We
   contrasted 14 environmental measures (most involving vegetation
   structure) for stations where N. sumichrasti was caught and not caught
   using logistic regression and nonparametric multiplicative regression,
   finding the species frequented sites flat to moderate in slope with
   considerable ground litter and relatively sparse high vegetation. In
   northern Colima, N. sumichrasti used areas with close trees, an open
   understory, and little grass. Other studies indicate the species
   sometimes occupies similar areas but with a relatively dense understory.

AB The state of Colima in western Mexico is part, of the transition zone
   between the two biogeographic regions of America, the Nearctic and the
   Neotropical. The state has particularly high mammalian diversity (128
   species) and is in the area with the greatest concentration of endemic
   species in Mexico (25%). As a result, there. is intrinsic scientific,
   interest in the study of mammals of Colima. However, the mammalian fauna
   has received only limited attention to date. There is no published
   Comprehensive inventory of mammals of Colima and only a few detailed
   reports of the species drat. occur at any given location within the
   state have been published. AS a contribution to the knowledge of mammals
   present in Colima, data were compiled on the mammals of Ejido Ranchitos,
   municipality of Minatitlan, and the species were Characterized. We
   recorded 35 species, 9 monotypic and 26 polytypic, gathering information
   on natural history and reproductive condition for each. These represent
   27.3% of species of mammals known from Colima and 7.4% of the total for
   Mexico. Eleven species were endemic, comprising 31.4% of species
   captured for Ejido Ranchitos and 6.5% of the endemic species for Mexico.
   Nonvolant mammals exhibited three reproductive patterns: continual
   polyestrous (10 species, 28.6%), seasonal polyestrous (4, 11.4%), and
   Seasonal monoestrous (3, 8.6%). Reproductive patterns for bats were
   seasonal monoestrous (7 species, 20.0%), asynchronic continual
   polyestrous (7, 20.0%), bimodal polyestrous (2, 5.7%), continual
   polyestrous (1, 2.9%), and asynchronic monoestrous (1, 2.9%). Three of
   the species we examined (Heteromys spectabilis Neotoma mexicana
   tennicauda, and Peromyscus hylocetes) have not been reported previously
   for Colima. Overall, Ejido Ranchitos supports a diverse fauna of
   small-sized and medium-sized mammals.

AB We investigated molar-crown-size variation, sexual dimorphism, and

   specimens (n = 429) from the island of Newfoundland, and museum
   specimens from elsewhere in Canada and the continental United States (n
   = 502). We predicted higher variation in and weaker correlations among
   molar size in this omnivorous species than in other species of Carnivora
   with dentition more specialized for carnivory, because of relatively
   weak normalizing selection on food-processing mechanisms in U.
   americanus. Molar-size variation in Newfoundland bears (mean coefficient
   of variation similar to 5.6%) was intermediate between species of
   Carnivora with simpler (e.g., pinnipeds) and more complex (e.g., canids)
   postcanine dentition. There was negligible size variation within the
   molar teeth, unlike some mammals. Bilateral symmetry was strong,
   especially in mandibular length (r similar to 1.0 between left and right
   sides; r similar to 0.95 for other mandibular and maxillary variables
   and molar size); symmetry in molar size was higher than ill phocid
   seals. Size was positively correlated across molars, especially between
   adjacent (but not occluding) molars; patterns were similar between sexes
   and geographic regions, and correlation levels did not differ from other
   species of Carnivora. We also predicted (and found) smaller sexual
   differences (= 100[(male/female) - 1]) in molar size than in body size,
   because definitive molar size is attained early in life: differences in
   molar size averaged similar to 5.5% in Newfoundland (higher in
   continental subsamples), which is less than differences ill cranial size
   (7-9%) or body mass(1/3) (21%). Sexes did not differ in relative molar
   size. Molar size was mainly isometric or positively allometric to adult
   body size (using mandibular and maxillary size as proxies).

   live-trap grids (each station with one ground and one arboreal trap; 10
   by 10 configuration) were set up for 8 nights in areas with dense
   vegetation. Only one tawny deermouse was caught in 2003. In 2004, we
   trapped 16 individuals (12 males, 4 females) 47 times, with 91.4% of
   captures being in arboreal traps. Captures in 2004 were at 25 stations,
   all on the same grid, in habitat representing a mixture of thorn forest,
   mangrove, and palm trees (density 13.6 mice/ha). Considering all 500
   trap stations in 2004, we used stepwise logistic regression to evaluate
   differences based on 13 structural-vegetation measures of the 25
   stations where tawny deermice were found versus the 475 where it was not
   caught. Tawny deermice tended to inhabit locations with trees close-by,
   sparse low-level vegetation, little litter, and dense high-level
   vegetation. For the one grid where we caught tawny deermice (25 stations
   where present versus 75 absent), only distance to nearest tree was
   significantly predictive; mice avoided even small forest openings. Tawny
   deermice were trapped at only a small subset of sites within what
   heretofore has been considered its suitable habitat. Evidence of
   restricted spatial structure and other limiting demographic features
   indicate a need for increased concern in conservation of this endemic

TI Predicting Raccoon, Procyon lotor, occurrence through the use of

AB Recent increases in Raccoon (Procyon lotor) abundance have been
   implicated for decreased nesting success of songbirds and transmission
   of rabies. Understanding the relationship between occurrence and
   microhabitat factors should be helpful in managing this species, though
   our current understanding of this relationship is inadequate. Therefore,
   we conducted a study in western Tennessee during 2000-2002 to determine
   this association. Occurrence (capture) data were assessed from results
   of live trapping at 176 and 112 trap sites during winter and summer,
   respectively, at three sites. A maximum of 26 habitat variables were
   measured at each trap location; all grids were combined for statistical
   analyses to account for varying relationships between occurrence and
   microhabitat factors across different landscapes. Univariate and
   stepwise logistic-regression analyses were used to assess associations
   among microhabitat variables and occurrence. Resulting models were
   validated through the jackknife procedure. Predictive equations were
   constructed from logistic-regression models to compute capture
   probabilities. Univariate analyses yielded numerous significant
   variables with those representing forest characteristics and proximity
   to water generally the most significant. Strong concordance was observed
   between winter and summer seasons for most variables though several
   differed (number of large hardwood snags, ground dens, and plant food
   species, distance to potential water and roads). Such temporal
   variability was expected due to seasonal differences in habitat
   components and biological needs of Raccoons. Variables included in
   derived models were similar to those scoring highest in univariate
   analyses; classification rates for models (winter = 72%; summer = 78%)
   were among the highest recorded for generalist species. By accounting
   for landscape attributes and replicating across sites, more accurate and
   useful models were developed. Such models should provide the information
   required to effectively manage this species.

AB Spatial variation in 26 morphological characters of American mink
   (Mustela vison) from 35 localities in North America was investigated
   using univariate and multivariate statistical analyses. Localities were
   chosen based on watersheds, and it was hypothesized that high levels of
   gene flow in minks would prevent partitioning of body size variation
   within watersheds. All 26 characters in males and 25 of 26 in females
   exhibited significant interlocality variation. The patterns of variation
   in body size resulting from principal components analysis indicated
   that, for both sexes, minks were largest in Alaska, Manitoba, and
   Alberta; smallest minks were found in Florida and Quebec. There did not
   appear to be a relationship between body size and geographic proximity.
   Environmental factors collectively were found to be related to body
   size, although individual variables were not typically significant. Of
   16 environmental variables examined, only longitude was correlated with
   body size in both sexes, with largest minks in the west and smallest in
   the east. Latitude was also correlated with body size in females. It was
   concluded that variation in body size of mink was likely the result of
   more than one factor that includes both biotic and abiotic features.

AB Information on hunter-effort-harvest-size relationships relevant to
   managing and monitoring hunted populations with multiple hunt types has
   not been examined in detail. We estimated harvest size from hunter
   effort in 6 types of hunts for white-tailed deer (Odocoileus
   virginianus) and compared intercepts and slopes to assess whether
   harvest size differed with hunting effort. The 6 hunt types were
   (age-sex class of population hunted and weapons allowed) as follows:
   antlerless gun (shotgun, centerfire rifle), either-sex archery,
   either-sex gun, either-sex muzzleloader, buck-only gun, and buck-only
   muzzleloader. The data set was a 12-year harvest record from a hunt
   program in western Tennessee. We measured hunter effort by hunter days
   (number of hunters and days they hunted). We detected differences in
   intercepts but not slopes among hunt types. Hunt types with largest
   harvest sizes were > 4 times larger than hunt types with smallest
   harvest sizes, controlling for hunter effort. Because slopes of
   regressions were similar, hunter effort among hunt types can be adjusted
   so that a harvest size:hunter effort ratio can be used to track relative
   deer population change.

AB Seventy-six American mink (Mustela vison) from 8 localities were
   genotyped using 4 polymorphic microsatellite loci. This study was
   designed to test the hypothesis that genetic structure was partitioned
   within streams due to the close association of mink with riparian
   habitats. Six of the localities were streams in Lonoke County in central
   Arkansas, one was in Independence County, 143 km from Lonoke County,
   Arkansas, and one was in Tipton County, Tennessee (204 km away from the
   populations in Lonoke County). values indicated that the Tipton County
   site was genetically distinct from those from Arkansas. However, most
   F-ST values among the 7 localities in Arkansas (6 in Lonoke County and
   one in Independence County) indicated little genetic difference among
   these sites. There was no statistically significant relationship between
   genetic and geographic distances. The straight-line distance between
   sites was positively correlated with genetic distances based on F-ST,
   while riverine distances were negatively correlated with genetic
   distances, indicating that straight-line distance was a better predictor
   of genetic structure in mink, perhaps due to overland movements among
   streams. Genetic structure was not partitioned within streams because
   there was substantial gene flow among streams.

AB Spatial patterns of sexual dimorphism in minks (Mustela vison) from 35
   localities in North America were examined using 25 cranial characters to
   test predictions of the resource partitioning hypothesis of sexual
   dimorphism. Specific hypotheses evaluated were that trophic structures
   would be among the most dimorphic and would not be strongly correlated
   to body size characters. Twenty of 25 characters were significantly
   larger in males. Predictions of the resource partitioning hypothesis
   were not supported as canine diameter, a widely used indicator of
   resource partitioning, was not sexually dimorphic and there was a
   relatively large correlation between body size traits and trophic
   traits. Significant spatial variation in degree of dimorphism was found.
   The patterns of sexual dimorphism from principal components analysis
   indicated that largest degrees of sexual dimorphism were found in minks
   from Pennsylvania and Florida and least degrees of dimorphism were in
   minks from Alaska and Quebec. Sexual dimorphism may have an important
   temporal component which should be investigated in further studies.

AB Knowledge of small-mammal population densities and species richness
   values are crucial to wildlife conservation and many ecological
   investigations. The relationship between estimates of absolute abundance
   and relative abundances of small-mammal populations is unclear.
   Therefore, from 1999-2001 measures of relative and absolute abundance of
   small mammals were compared across a terrestrial landscape using 3
   vegetation communities (forest, early-successional field, and
   forest-field edge) in western Tennessee. We used a catch/unit effort
   index derived from transect sampling to estimate relative abundance and
   2 estimates of absolute abundance, Mt+1 (the number of unique
   individuals captured) and N-est (a population estimate obtained from
   statistical models). These 2 estimates were derived from mark-recapture
   sampling on trapping grids. Using both sampling procedures, we conducted
   trapping with Sherman live traps during autumn, winter, and spring for 2
   years. We tested the prediction that the pattern of total captures of
   small mammals across a landscape from a catch/unit effort index reflects
   the same pattern as those derived from Mt+I and N-est. Also, we tested
   the prediction that the pattern of species richness of small mammals
   derived from a catch/unit effort index on transects corresponds with the
   species richness based on Mt+1 determined from grid sampling. We
   conducted comparisons of patterns using a Spearman rank correlation
   coefficient. Overall, we captured 988 small mammals, representing 9
   genera and 11 species. The pattern of captures from the catch/unit
   effort index was proportional to those derived from Mt+l and N-est. (P
   <= 0.001 in each correlation analysis; rs(17)=0.880 and rs(17)=0.810,
   respectively). The pattern of species richness derived from the
   catch/unit effort index was similar to those derived from the
   mark-recapture sampling (P <= 0.001; rs(17)=0.861). Capture frequencies
   across vegetation communities and within seasons from both transect
   sampling and grid sampling did not differ for 4 of 6
   seasons(chi(2)(2)=4.4329, P=0.1090; chi(2)(2)=18.2224, P=0.0001;
   chi(2)(2)=0.2129, P=0.8990; chi(2)(2)=1.6395, P=0.4405; chi(2)(2)=
   3.8688, P =0.1445; chi(2)(2)=7.1750, P=0.0277). Results of this study
   suggest that measures of relative abundance provide patterns of
   population trends proportional to those derived from estimates of
   absolute abundance.

AB To assess the usefulness of morphologic characters in identifying deer
   mice (Peromyscus maniculatus), white-footed mice (P. leucopus) and

   measurements were recorded for two groups of these rodents. Each group
   contained individuals of the three species. One assemblage represented
   known individuals (species identifications verified rising
   electrophoretic techniques) and the other unknowns (species
   identification not verified; test group). With the known group, we
   developed a system of identification based on selected morphologic
   features. These features were used to determine the identification of
   individuals in the test group. Following identification, individuals
   identified in the test group were confirmed using electrophoretic
   procedures. Two characters (greatest length of skull and length of
   hindfoot) separated 100% and 91% of P. gassypinus in the known group and
   94.6% and 98% in the test. group, respectively. A single external metric
   (tail length/total length) correctly classified 95% of P. maniculatus in
   both the known and test groups. A suite of four cranial (greatest length
   of skull, length of nasal, post-palatal length and length of diastema)
   and one external character (length of tail) correctly classified all of
   the individuals in the initial group and 90%, 91% and 100% of P.
   maniculatus, P. leucopus and P. gossypinus, respectively, in the test
   group. We concluded that morphologic characters can be used to
   accurately detect species of Peromyscus in sympatry.

   history of the Forest and the mobility of animals are given as potential
   explanations for a poor relationship between abiotic ELTs and the

   Mountains of eastern Tennessee during three seasons (winter 1996, spring
   1996, and winter 1997) from mark-recapture data using a modified
   Lincoln-Peterson estimator and program CAPTURE. Density was estimated at
   1.30 squirrels/ha and 1.53 squirrels/ha using Lincoln-Peterson and
   program CAPTURE, respectively, during both winter 1996 and spring 1996.
   No squirrels were captured in winter 1997. Winter and spring 1996
   density estimates approached those reported for Red Squirrel populations
   in boreal spruce (Picea sp.) forest, which is regarded as optimal
   habitat. The cause of the population decline between spring 1996 and
   winter 1997 was unknown.

AB Starch-gel electrophoresis was used to assess temporal genetic variation
   in a population of raccoon, Procyon lotor. Specimens (n = 1,056) were
   collected during nine annual hunts (1984-1992) at Reelfoot National
   Wildlife Refuge, Obion Co., Tennessee, and Fulton Co., Kentucky. Of 41
   loci examined, 35 were monomorphic; 6 exhibited polymorphism and were
   used in statistical analyses. Heterozygosity ranged from 0.033 (1990) to
   0.046 (1992) with a mean of 0.042; however, differences across years
   were not significant. Significant deviations from Hardy-Weinberg
   equilibrium were minimal. Chi-square contingency analysis revealed
   significant differences in allelic frequencies among years for four of
   the six polymorphic loci. Wright's F-statistics indicated significant
   differentiation among years (F-ST = 0.042). Rogers' genetic similarity
   coefficients ranged from 0.836 to 0.973. The matrix of all pairwise
   comparisons indicated a random pattern of relationships among years.
   Hunting appears to have had little influence on the genetic composition
   of raccoons in the study area over the 9-year period. The observed
   pattern of low-level temporal variation is probably the result of
   stochastic events.

AB Demography and food habits of river otters (Lutra canadensis) in western
   Tennessee were examined. Gastro-intestinal tracts of 125 specimens (75
   males, 49 females, and 1 of undetermined sex) were examined for contents
   by season, sex, and age. Demographic information was connected from 179
   river otters (104 males, 71 females, and 4 of undetermined sex). Four
   external measurements (total length, tail length, hind foot length, and
   ear length), year, season, county, sex, whole weight, and skinned weight
   were recorded for each animal if available. Analysis of variance was
   used to determine differences in all measurements across sex, age, year,
   and season. Embryos and placental scars from nine female river otters
   were counted to determine average litter size. Results of analysis of
   digestive tracts indicated that fish and crayfish were the most frequent
   food types observed with amphibians, mollusks, and insects occurring
   less frequently while mammals occurred in only trace amounts. Results of
   demographic information showed an overall sex ratio of 1.5 males:1.0
   females; the overall age class ratio was 3.0 adults:1.0 juvenile. Ratios
   of adult males:adult females and juvenile males:juvenile females
   approached 1.0:1.0. River otters showed significant differences by sex
   for all weights and three of four external measurements (total length,
   tail length, and hind foot length) with males larger than females.
   Significant differences between age classes within each sex were
   observed for all weights and two of four external measurements (total
   length and tail length) with adult males largest and juvenile females
   the smallest. Average litter size calculated was 2.6 pups/female with a
   range of one to four.

   studied in the Ouachira Mountains of west-central Arkansas daring the
   winters of 1990-1991 and 1991-1992. Because traditional planimetric home
   ranges do not account for differences in topography a Geographic
   Information System (GIS) which incorporated topography was also used to
   determine home range. Mean female and male planimetric and
   (topographical) home-range estimates were 3.8 ha (3.9 ha) and 7.8 ha
   (9.0 ha), respectively Differences in home-range size were not
   statistically significant between sexes, however, home-range estimates
   of males were more variable. Topographic estimates were significantly
   larger than planimetric estimates. The GIS more clearly represents home
   range with respect to habitat characteristics in the context of
   topographic features and it should be used in future studies.

   significantly different among localities. With the exception of
   Oklahoma, significant deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium
   occurred at all localities. Wright's F-statistics indicated an overall
   significant degree of differentiation among populations. Rogers' genetic
   similarity values, ranging from 0.724 to 0.932, exhibited a pattern of

   sites in southwestern Tennessee. Measurements were recorded to the
   nearest 0.01 mm from 371 adult specimens. Univariate and multivariate
   statistical procedures were used to analyze data. Significant
   interlocality variation was shown by all characters examined. Relative
   to the degree of intraspecific heterogeneity, bullae width, greatest
   skull depth, and rostral height had the highest F-ratios. Lowest
   F-values were found for width between the second molars, mandibular
   toothrow length, first molar width, scapula length, anterior zygomatic
   width, mandible height, and greatest optic foramen length. A matrix of
   correlations among characters was computed, and the first three
   principal components were extracted. These components accounted for
   98.7% of the total phenetic variance in the character set. A
   three-dimensional projection of localities onto the first three
   principal components revealed a pattern of morphologic variation
   unrelated to geographic proximity as well as major habitat types and
   broad climatic variables. Patterns of local variation may be expected to
   be less predictable and differ from those found on larger spatial

AB Interspecific morphometric variation among 19 species of kangaroo rats
   (genus Dipodomys) was examined using discriminant-function analysis.
   Discriminant functions I, II, and III accounted for 53.0, 18.3, and
   12.6%, respectively, of the discrimination in males, and 48.9, 19.7, and
   13.0%, respectively, of the discrimination in females. Geographic
   samples were classified to the correct species for 99.6% of the samples.
   Magnitude of intraspecific variation was related to the size of a
   species' geographic distribution. Samples segregated into three major
   aggregations. The first contained the majority of taxa and consisted of
   smaller species. The second aggregation comprised most of the larger
   taxa (D. ingens, D. nelsoni, D. spectabilis). Samples of D. deserti were
   the sole members of the third aggregation. Morphologically similar taxa
   often were allopatric (e.g., D. californicus, D. elator, D. heermanni,
   D. panamintinus, D. phillipsii) or had different microhabitat
   preferences where syntopic (e.g., D. merriami, D. ordii). Other taxa
   that had generally similar body sizes and overlapping geographic
   distributions were morphometrically distinct (e.g., D. microps and D.
   ordii, D. merriami and D. microps, D. compactus and D. ordii). These
   more subtly defined morphometric differences probably are reflections of
   adaptations allowing superficially similar species to occupy the same

AB Cranial characters of Felis rufus from the eastern United States were

   variation in sexual dimorphism was found in five of 17 characters. Only
   two of 28 selected environmental variables examined were found to he
   correlated with morphologic variation. The pattern of variation produced
   from principal components analysis suggested that F. rufus from
   mountainous areas tended to be more sexually dimorphic in size than
   animals from areas of little topographic relief. Explanations may
   include sexual differences in an equilibrium between selection for small
   size to minimize energy expense associated with locomotion and selection
   for large size to maximize reproductive success.

AB Geographic variation of sexual dimorphism for 22 cranial characters was

   variation in the degree of sexual dimorphism occurred only for canine
   width and the degree of sexual dimorphism in canine width was
   significantly less for raccoons from W of the Continental Divide than
   those from E of the Continental Divide. The lack of geographic variation
   in sexual dimorphism of greatest length of skull indicates that sexual
   dimorphism in body size of raccoons also does not vary geographically
   (skull length is highly correlated with body size). Thus, it appears
   that selection pressures responsible for sexual dimorphism in raccoons
   are acting uniformly throughout much of the range of the species.
   Geographic variation in the degree of sexual dimorphism for canine width
   may be the result of geographic variation in the intensity of
   intrasexual selection (i.e., variation in the intensity of male-male
   competition for mates during the breeding season). If so, the apparent
   lack of geographic variation in sexual size dimorphism of raccoons may
   indicate that male body size is not under the same kinds of selection
   pressures (e.g., intrasexual selection) as canine size.
