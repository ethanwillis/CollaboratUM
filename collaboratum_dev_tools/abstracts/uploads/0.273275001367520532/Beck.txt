AB We studied the interactive effect of ultraviolet-B radiation and the
   heavy metal copper on the tadpole fitness of the Spring Peeper
   (Pseudacris crucifer). Many studies have identified UV-B effects on
   amphibian survival while others have examined the effects of heavy
   metals, such as copper; however, few studies have investigated the
   possibility of interactive effects between UV-B and heavy metals on
   amphibian fitness. Tadpoles were reared in laboratory containers and
   tested to ascertain whether UV-B and Cu had interactive effects on P.
   crucifer fitness. Exposure to UV-B and Cu individually and interactively
   significantly affected P. crucifer survival. This suggests that in some
   areas amphibian survival could be impacted due to abiotic interactions.

TI Using morphologic characters to identify Peromyscus in sympatry

AB To assess the usefulness of morphologic characters in identifying deer
   mice (Peromyscus maniculatus), white-footed mice (P. leucopus) and
   cotton mice (P. gossypinus) in sympatry, cranial and external
   measurements were recorded for two groups of these rodents. Each group
   contained individuals of the three species. One assemblage represented
   known individuals (species identifications verified rising
   electrophoretic techniques) and the other unknowns (species
   identification not verified; test group). With the known group, we
   developed a system of identification based on selected morphologic
   features. These features were used to determine the identification of
   individuals in the test group. Following identification, individuals
   identified in the test group were confirmed using electrophoretic
   procedures. Two characters (greatest length of skull and length of
   hindfoot) separated 100% and 91% of P. gassypinus in the known group and
   94.6% and 98% in the test. group, respectively. A single external metric
   (tail length/total length) correctly classified 95% of P. maniculatus in
   both the known and test groups. A suite of four cranial (greatest length
   of skull, length of nasal, post-palatal length and length of diastema)
   and one external character (length of tail) correctly classified all of
   the individuals in the initial group and 90%, 91% and 100% of P.
   maniculatus, P. leucopus and P. gossypinus, respectively, in the test
   group. We concluded that morphologic characters can be used to
   accurately detect species of Peromyscus in sympatry.

AB Chromosomal polymorphism was assessed in the southern short-tailed shrew
   (Blarina carolinensis) using standard metaphase chromosome and G-banding
   techniques. Twenty-one animals (11 males, 10 females) from the Meeman
   Biological Station in Shelby Co., Tennessee, were examined for diploid
   number. Results showed diploid numbers of 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40 and 41
   and fundamental numbers of 41, 42, 43, 44 and 45. No diploid numbers or
   fundamental numbers were unique to a specific collecting locality. The
   first G-banded karyotypes are reported for the species. These results
   indicate that Robertsonian polymorphisms, inversions, and possibly other
   events are responsible for chromosomal variation in B. carolinensis.
