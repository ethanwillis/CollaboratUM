AB The intermediate filament protein synemin is present in astrocyte
   progenitors and glioblastoma cells but not in mature astrocytes. Here we
   demonstrate a role for synemin in enhancing glioblastoma cell
   proliferation and clonogenic survival, as synemin RNA interference
   decreased both behaviors by inducing G1 arrest along with Rb
   hypophosphorylation and increased protein levels of the G1/S inhibitors
   p21(Cip1) and p27(Kip1). Akt involvement was demonstrated by decreased
   phosphorylation of its substrate, p21(Cip1), and reduced Akt catalytic
   activity and phosphorylation at essential activation sites. Synemin
   silencing, however, did not affect the activities of PDPK1 and mTOR
   complex 2, which directly phosphorylate Akt activation sites, but
   instead enhanced the activity of the major regulator of Akt
   dephosphorylation, protein phosphatase type 2A (PP2A). This was
   accompanied by changes in PP2A subcellular distribution resulting in
   increased physical interactions between PP2A and Akt, as shown by
   proximity ligation assays (PLAs). PLAs and immunoprecipitation
   experiments further revealed that synemin and PP2A form a protein
   complex. In addition, treatment of synemin-silenced cells with the PP2A
   inhibitor cantharidic acid resulted in proliferation and pAkt and pRb
   levels similar to those of controls. Collectively these results indicate
   that synemin positively regulates glioblastoma cell proliferation by
   helping sequester PP2A away from Akt, thereby favoring Akt activation.

AB Purpose: To examine the expression patterns of the intermediate filament
   (IF) proteins nestin and synemin following retinal injury.
   Methods: Wide-scale retinal injuries were created by experimental
   retinal detachment of 1, 3, 7, or 30 days' duration. Injuries were
   induced in the right eyes of Long Evans rats, while the left eyes served
   as internal controls. Vibratome sections of control and injured retinas
   were labeled with fluorescent probes using a combination of anti-glial
   fibrillary acidic protein, -vimentin, -nestin, -synemin,
   -bromodeoxyuridine, and the lectin probe, isolectin B4. Additionally,
   antibody specificity, as well as protein and mRNA levels of nestin and
   synemin were determined and quantified using standard western blotting
   and real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) techniques.
   Results: Immunocytochemistry showed increased Muller cell labeling at 1,
   3, and 7 days post injury for all four IFs, although the relative levels
   of nestin expression varied dramatically between individual Muller
   cells. Nestin was consistently observed in the foremost processes of
   those Muller cells that grew into the subretinal space, forming glial
   scars. Elevated levels of nestin expression were also observed in
   bromodeoxyuridine-labeled Muller cells following retinal insult.
   Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) showed a twofold increase
   in nestin mRNA 1 day after injury, a level maintained at 3 and 7 days.
   Western blotting using anti-nestin showed a single band at 220 kDa and
   the intensity of this band increased following injury. Anti-synemin
   labeling of control retinas revealed faint labeling of astrocytes; this
   increased after injury, demonstrating an association with blood vessels.
   Additionally, there was an upregulation of synemin in Muller cells. qPCR
   and western blotting with anti-synemin showed a continuous increase in
   both gene and protein expression over time.
   Conclusions: Retinal injury induces an upregulation of a complement of
   four intermediate filament proteins, including synemin and nestin, in
   Muller cells. The latter provides suggestive support for the concept
   that these cells may revert to a more developmentally immature state,
   since these two IF proteins are developmentally regulated and expressed,
   and thus may serve as cell cycle reentry markers. Nestin and its
   differential expression patterns with glial fibrillary acidic protein
   and vimentin networks, as well as its association with proliferating
   Muller cells and those extending into the subretinal space, suggest a
   significant role of this protein in glial scar formation and perhaps
   gliogenesis. Synemin immunopositive astrocytes demonstrate a close
   relationship to the retinal vasculature, and illustrate a remarkable
   ability to reorganize their morphology in response to injury. Further
   examination of the changes in the cytoskeletal signatures of both of
   these glial cell types may lead to a more comprehensive understanding of
   mechanisms underway following retinal and other central nervous system
   injuries.

AB alpha-Actinin is a prominent actin filament associated protein for which
   different isoforms exist. Here, we have examined whether the two highly
   homologous non-muscle alpha-actinin isoforms 1 and 4 exhibit functional
   differences in astrocytoma cells. The protein levels of these isoforms
   were differentially regulated during the development and progression of
   astrocytomas, as alpha-actinin 1 was higher in astrocytomas compared to
   normal brains whereas alpha-actinin 4 was elevated in highgrade
   astrocytomas compared to normal brains and low grade astrocytomas. RNAi
   demonstrated contrasted contributions of alpha-actinin 1 and 4 to the
   malignant behavior of U-373. U-87 and A172 astrocytoma cells. While
   alpha-actinin 1 appeared to favor the expansion of U-373. U-87 and A172
   astrocytoma cell populations, alpha-actinin 4 played this role only for
   U-373 cells. On the other hand, downregulation of alpha-actinin 4, but
   not 1, reduced cell motility, adhesion, cortical actin, and RhoA levels.
   Finally, in the three astrocytoma cell lines examined, alpha-actinin 1
   and 4 had contrasted biochemical properties as alpha-actinin 4 was
   significantly more abundant in the actin cytoskeleton than alpha-actinin
   1. Collectively, these findings suggest that alpha-actinin 1 and 4 are
   differentially regulated during the development and progression of
   astrocytomas because each of these isoforms uniquely contributes to
   distinct malignant properties of astrocytoma cells. Published by

AB Acidic extracellular pH (pHe) is a common feature of the tumor
   microenvironment and has been implicated in tumor invasion through the
   induction of protease secretion. Since lysosomes constitute the major
   storehouse of cellular proteases, the trafficking of lysosomes to the
   cell periphery may be required in order to secrete proteases. We
   demonstrate that a pHe of 6.4-6.8 induced the trafficking of lysosomes
   to membrane protrusions in the cell periphery. This trafficking event
   depended upon the PI3K pathway, the GTPase RhoA and sodium-proton
   exchange activity, resulting in lysosomal exocytosis. Acidic pHe induced
   a cytoplasmic acidification (although cytoplasmic acidification was not
   sufficient for acidic pHe-induced lysosome trafficking and exocytosis)
   and inhibition of NHE activity with the amiloride derivative, EIPA or
   the anti-diabetic agent troglitazone prevented lysosome trafficking to
   the cell periphery. Interestingly, using the more specific NHE1 and NHE3
   inhibitors, cariporide and s3226 respectively, we show that multiple NHE
   isoforms are involved in acidic pHe-induced lysosome trafficking and
   exocytosis. Moreover, in cells expressing NHE1 shRNA, although basal NHE
   activity was decreased, lysosomes still underwent acidic pHe-induced
   trafficking, suggesting compensation by other NHE family members.
   Together these data implicate proton exchangers, especially NHE1 and
   NHE3, in acidic pHe-induced lysosome trafficking and exocytosis.

AB Since the discovery of neuropathological lesions made of TDP-43 and
   ubiquitin proteins in cases of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD)
   and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), there is a burst of effort on
   finding related familial mutations and developing animal models. We used
   an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector for human TDP-43 expression
   targeted to the substantia nigra (SN) of rats. Though TDP-43 was
   expressed mainly in neuronal nuclei as expected, it was also expressed
   in the cytoplasm, and dotted along the plasma membrane of neurons.
   Cytoplasmic staining was both diffuse and granular, indicative of
   preinclusion lesions, over 4 weeks. Ubiquitin deposited in the
   cytoplasm, specifically in the TDP-43 group, and staining for microglia
   was increased dose-dependently by 1-2 logs in the TDP-43 group, while
   neurons were selectively obliterated. Neuronal death induced by TDP-43
   was pyknotic and apoptotic. TDP-43 gene transfer caused loss of
   dopaminergic neurons in the SN and their axons in the striatum.
   Behavioral motor dysfunction resulted after TDP-43 gene transfer that
   was vector dose-dependent and progressive over time. The cytoplasmic
   expression, ubiquitination, and neurodegeneration mimicked features of
   the TDP-43 diseases, and the gliosis, apoptosis, and motor impairment
   may also be relevant to TDP-43 disease forms involving nigrostriatal
   degeneration.

AB We have shown previously that, in astrocytoma cells, synemin is present
   at the leading edge, an unusual localization for an intermediate
   filament (IF) protein. Here, we report that synemin down-regulation with
   specific small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) sharply decreased the migration of
   astrocytoma cells. The presence of synemin at the leading edge also
   correlated with a high migratory potential, as shown by comparing
   astrocytoma cells to carcinoma cells without synemin at the leading
   edge. Synemin-silenced astrocytoma cells were smaller and spread more
   slowly than controls. In addition, synemin silencing reduced
   proliferation without increasing apoptosis. The adhesion to substratum
   and distribution of vinculin in focal contacts of synemin-silenced
   astrocytoma cells were similar to those of controls. Synemin-silenced
   cells, however, exhibited a reduction in the amount of filamentous (F)
   -actin and of alpha-actinin, but not of vinculin, associated with
   F-actin. Altogether, these results demonstrate that synemin is important
   for the malignant behavior of astrocytoma cells and that it contributes
   to the high motility of these cells by modulating the dynamics of
   alpha-actinin and actin.

AB Dermatomyositis (DM) is a canine and human inflammatory disease of the
   skin and muscle that is thought to be autoimmune in nature. In dogs, DM
   occurs most often in the rough collie and Shetland sheepdog.
   Characteristic skin lesions typically develop on the face, ears, tail,
   and distal extremities. The severity of lesions varies and is thought to
   increase with stressful stimuli. Previous studies in the collie suggest
   that DM is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion with incomplete
   penetrance. The work presented here concerns gene transcripts profiling
   and immunobiology of DM in the Shetland sheepdog. Gene transcript
   profiles were generated for affected and normal skin using a
   canine-specific oligonucleotide array having 49,929 probe sets.
   Two-hundred and eight-five gene transcripts, many of which are involved
   in immune function, were found to be differentially regulated in these
   tissues. Also reported are Western blot, immunohistochemistry, and
   immunofluorescence analyses which showed that staining patterns with
   sera from normal and affected dogs are quite similar. While our work
   suggests that canine DM is a disease that may be immune mediated, it did
   not detect the production of specific disease-associated autoantibodies.

AB Immature astrocytes and astrocytoma cells contain synemin and three
   other intermediate filament (IF) proteins: glial fibrillary acidic
   protein (GFAP), vimentin and nestin. Here, we show that, after
   neurotrauma, reactive astrocytes produce synemin and thus propose
   synemin as a new marker of reactive astrocytes. Comparison of synemin
   mRNA and protein levels in brain tissues and astrocyte cultures from
   wild-type, Vim(-/-) and Gfap(-/-) Vim(-/-) mice showed that in the
   absence of vimentin, synemin protein was undetectable although synemin
   mRNA was present at wild-type levels. By contrast, in Gfap(-/-)
   astrocytes, synemin protein and mRNA levels, as well as synemin
   incorporation into vimentin IFs, were unaltered. Biochemical assays with
   purified proteins suggested that synemin interacts with GFAP IFs like an
   IF-associated protein rather than like a polymerization partner, whereas
   the opposite was true for synemin interaction with vimentin. In
   transfection experiments, synemin did not incorporate into normal,
   filamentous GFAP networks, but integrated into vimentin and GFAP
   heteropolymeric networks. Thus, alongside GFAP, vimentin and nestin,
   reactive astrocytes contain synemin, whose accumulation is suppressed
   post-transcriptionally in the absence of a polymerization partner. In
   astrocytes, this partner is vimentin and not GFAP, which implies a
   functional difference between these two type III IF proteins.

AB The expression profile of intermediate filament proteins provides
   valuable information on the differentiation of specific cell populations
   and their contributions to disease. Synemin is one of the few
   intermediate filament proteins whose expression pattern during
   pathological situations is poorly characterized. We conducted a
   systematic immunohistochemical investigation of synemin expression in
   human liver diseases. In normal liver and in the early prefibrotic phase
   of chronic viral hepatitis or steatoliepatitis, synemin was localized in
   hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and vascular cells. Fibrotic or cirrhotic
   liver disease promoted intense synemin staining of HSCs in parenchymal
   and fibrous zones. In portal tract fibroblasts, synemin expression was
   rare under normal conditions but was widespread in severe inflammatory
   diseases associated with portal expansion, consistent with the notion
   that some fibrotic reactions involve HSCs, whereas others involve both
   HSCs and portal fibroblasts. Most sinusoidal endothelial cells were
   synemin negative in normal liver but were positive in hepatocellular
   carcinomas. Synemin was also expressed in the epithelial component of
   the ductular reaction in various liver diseases and in
   cholangiocarcinoma cells but not in hepatocellular carcinoma cells.
   Myofibroblasts in stromal reaction to carcinomas were synemin positive.
   Thus, synemin helps delineate different types of liver fibrotic
   reactions and provides a marker for sinusoidal capillarization and for
   proliferating biliary epithelial and cholangiocarcinoma cells. (c) 2006

AB Transgenic mice studies have suggested that transforming growth
   factor-alpha (TGF-alpha) influences the postnatal differentiation of
   astrocytes. To understand the role of TGF-alpha during astrocytic
   differentiation, it is important to determine how this factor affects
   astrocytes in the absence of other influences. We have thus examined in
   vitro under serum-free medium conditions the effect of TGF-alpha on the
   properties of astrocytes derived from the cerebral cortex of newborn
   rats. When TGF-alpha is added to serum-free medium, most astrocytes lose
   their polygonal shape and extend two long processes running in opposite
   directions. This bipolar morphology strikingly resembles that of radial
   glial cells. Intriguingly, serum inhibits this morphological
   transformation. TGF-alpha also triggers an increase in glial fibrillary
   acidic protein (GFAP) expression and a decrease in nestin expression.
   Another major effect of TGF-alpha is to practically abolish the motility
   of astrocytes. TGF-alpha, however, does not appear to influence the
   proliferation and apoptosis of astrocytes. These results suggest that
   polygonal astrocytes are derived primarily from radial glial cells, and
   that in vivo TGF-alpha may be instrumental in determining the shape and
   migratory potential of radial glial cells. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science

AB Transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha) and its receptor are
   frequently co-expressed in high-grade astrocytomas, suggesting a role
   for TCF-alpha autocrine/paracrine loops in the malignant progression of
   astrocytomas. To identify genes that may be critical in mediating
   TGF-alpha impact on the malignant progression of astrocytomas, we have
   used cDNA arrays to investigate TGF-alpha effects on the gene expression
   profile of U-373 MG glioblastoma cells. We found that in these cells
   similar to 50% of the TGF-alpha regulated genes code for cell
   motility/invasion-related proteins. TGF-alpha action on the expression
   of four of these proteins, alpha -catenin, IQGAP1, RhoA, and
   cadherin-ll, was further investigated by immunoblotting in four
   astrocytoma cell lines and in normal astrocytes. The results demonstrate
   that the effects of TGF-alpha on IQGAP1, alpha -catenin, and RhoA
   expression are cell-line dependent. On the other hand, under TGF-alpha
   treatment, cadherin-li expression is consistently decreased in all
   astrocytoma cell lines tested but is increased in normal astrocytes. In
   addition, we found that cadherin-ll is consistently down-regulated in
   astrocytomas versus normal brain tissues. Altogether, these results
   suggest that the down-regulation of cadherin-ll is a frequent molecular
   event in the neoplastic transformation of astrocytes and that this
   down-regulation may be initiated and/or amplified by TGF-alpha
   autocrine/paracrine loops during tumor progression.

AB To begin understanding the regulation and biological significance of
   changes in the expression of intermediate filament proteins in
   astrocytic tumors, we have recently shown that TGF-alpha alters the
   protein level of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), nestin, and
   vimentin in U-373 MG glioblastoma cells, Here, we have determined the
   molecular mechanisms regulating these changes. In addition, to evaluate
   the significance of these changes we have examined whether TGF-alpha
   affects various cellular properties related to differentiation. Our
   results show that, in U-373 MG cells treated with TGF-alpha, GFAP gene
   transcription, mRNA level, and specific protein synthesis decrease by
   similar to 50%. This suggests that, in U-373 MG cells, TGF-alpha
   down-regulates the expression of this marker of astrocytic
   differentiation at the transcriptional level, resulting in decreased
   GFAP mRNA level and specific protein synthesis. In contrast, TGF-alpha
   does not change vimentin gene transcription, but increases by about 50%
   the transcription of the gene for nestin, a marker for undifferentiated
   astrocytic precursors. This differential regulation of GFAP, nestin, and
   vimentin gene expression indicates that TGF-alpha induces further
   dedifferentiation of U-373 MG cells. This notion is also supported by
   our findings that TGF-alpha increases the motility of U-373 MG cells and
   induces a less stellate morphology. (C) 2000 Academic Press.

AB Various growth factors and basement membrane proteins have been
   implicated in the pathobiology of astrocytomas, The goal of this study
   was to determine the relative contribution of these two factors in
   modulating the phenotype of U-373 MG glioblastoma cells as determined by
   the expression of the intermediate filament proteins glial fibrillary
   acidic protein, vimentin, and nestin, For these determinations, cells
   plated in serum-free medium were treated either with growth factors
   binding to tyrosine kinase receptors including transforming growth
   factor-alpha, epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived growth
   factor-AA, basic fibroblast growth factor, and insulin-like growth
   factor-1 or with basement membrane proteins including collagen IV,
   laminin, and fibronectin, The changes in the expression levels of
   intermediate filament proteins in response to these treatments were
   analyzed by quantitation of immunoblots, The results demonstrate that
   collagen IV and growth factors binding to tyrosine kinase receptors
   decrease the glial fibrillary acidic protein content of U-373 MG cells.
   Growth factors binding to tyrosine kinase receptors also decrease the
   vimentin content of these cells but do not affect their nestin content,
   On the other hand, basement membrane proteins decrease the nestin
   content of U-373 MG cells but do not affect their vimentin content. The
   significance of these results with respect to the role played by
   different factors in modulating the phenotype of neoplastic astrocytes
   during tumor progression is discussed.

AB Several studies have shown that immunoenzymatic staining of
   formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded astrocytomas with keratin antibodies
   frequently yields positive labelling, but no biochemical evidence of
   keratin expression in astrocytomas has been reported. We have
   investigated the presence of keratin in astrocytoma on normal brain
   tissues both by immunofluorescence on frozen sections and by 1D and 2D
   immunoblotting using seven monoclonal antibodies that, collectively,
   recognize most keratin polypeptides. Four of these antibodies did not
   stain neural tissues by immunofluorescence and were also negative by
   immunoblotting. The remaining three keratin antibodies stained normal
   brain and/or a high proportion of astrocytomas. Two of these three
   antibodies only stained glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive
   cells, while the third only stained GFAP-negative cells. 1D and 2D
   immunoblotting analysis showed that positive immunofluorescence staining
   of normal brain and/or astrocytomas seen with these three keratin
   antibodies was due to cross-reactivity with non-keratin proteins, such
   as GFAP. These results demonstrate that, contrary to earlier
   suggestions, keratin polypeptides are not frequently expressed in
   astrocytomas. Our studies also emphasize that keratin antibodies should
   be used cautiously for the differential diagnosis of undifferentiated
   gliomas from tumours of non-glial origin.

AB Under normal culture conditions, epithelial cells of the FG line,
   derived from a pancreatic tumor, characteristically grow in mounds and
   fail to flatten efficiently onto their substrate. In such cells, keratin
   intermediate filaments (Ifs) are concentrated in the perinuclear region.
   Furthermore, the IF associated protein, IFAP300, primarily localizes
   along these keratin bundles. Additionally, alpha 6 beta 4 integrin
   heterodimers localize in streaks or spots towards the edges of cells
   while alpha 3 beta 1 integrin is predominantly at cell-cell surfaces.
   Neither show any obvious interaction with IF. Remarkably, upon plating
   FG cells into medium containing soluble rat laminin-5, FG cells rapidly
   adhere and spread onto their substrate. Moreover, FG cells ''capture''
   rat laminin-5 and place it basally in circles or arcs at areas of
   cell-substrate interaction. Double label immunofluorescence microscopy
   reveals colocalization of 1FAP300 as well as alpha 6 beta 4 and alpha 3
   beta 1 integrin with the polarized laminin-5. Concomitantly, alpha 6
   integrin undergoes dephosphorylation on serine residue 1041.
   Laminin-5-induced rapid adhesion can be blocked by antibodies against
   the alpha 3 integrin subunit. In contrast, while alpha 6 integrin
   antibodies do not block laminin-5-induced rapid adhesion, they prevent
   FG cells from assuming an epithelial-like morphology. Keratin IF bundles
   associate with IFAP300-alpha 6 beta 4/alpha 3 beta 1 integrin complexes
   along the cell-substratum-attached surface of FG cells coincubated in
   laminin-5-containing medium. Coprecipitation results suggest that in
   these complexes, 1FAP300 may associate with the alpha 6 beta 4 integrin
   heterodimer. Based on our results and published evidence that IFAP300
   binds keratin in vitro [Skalli et al., 1994; J. Cell Biol. 125:159-170],
   we propose that laminin-5/FG cell interaction results in a novel
   integrin dephosphorylation event, which subsequently induces IFAP300
   association with alpha 6 beta 4 integrin. IFAP300 then mediates the
   interaction of Ifs with the cell surface via the alpha 6 beta 4 integrin
   heterodimer. (C) 1997 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB The distribution of IFAP 300, a protein previously characterized as
   cross-linking vimentin intermediate filaments (IF), has been
   investigated in epithelial cells. In frozen sections of bovine tongue
   epithelium the staining obtained with IFAP 300 antibodies is
   concentrated in the peripheral cytoplasm of keratinocytes, including the
   entire peripheral region of basal cells. Further immunofluorescence
   studies reveal that in primary cultures of mouse keratinocytes the
   distribution of IFAP 300 is similar to that of the desmosomal protein
   desmoplakin. In rat bladder carcinoma 804G cells the staining pattern of
   IFAP 300 antibodies coincides with that obtained with antibodies against
   the hemidesmosomal protein BP 230. By immunogold electron microscopy
   IFAP 300 is mainly located at sites where IF appear to attach to
   desmosomes and hemidesmosomes. Morphometric analyses of the distribution
   of the gold particles show that IFAP 300 overlaps with desmoplakin and
   BP 230, but also that it extends deeper into the cytoplasm than these
   latter two proteins. The staining reaction seen in epithelial cells by
   immunofluorescence and immunogold is specific for IFAP 300 as shown by
   immunoblotting. Immunoblotting also reveals that IFAP 300 is present in
   both cell-free preparations of desmosomes and hemidesmosomes. These
   morphological and biochemical results are intriguing since, in recent
   years, the proteins appearing in these two types of junctions have been
   found to be different. One possible exception is plectin, a protein that
   has been suggested to be very similar to IFAP 300. However, we show here
   that IFAP 300 differs from plectin in several respects, including
   differences at the primary sequence level. We also show that purified
   IFAP 300 pellets with in vitro polymerized IF prepared from
   desmosome-associated keratins under conditions in which IFAP 300 alone
   is not sedimentable. This indicates that IFAP 300 can associate with
   keratin IF These data, taken together with the immunogold results,
   suggest that IFAP 300 functions in epithelial cells as a linker protein
   connecting IF to desmosomes as well as to hemidesmosomes, possibly
   through structurally related proteins such as desmoplakin and BP 230,
   respectively.
