   Genomics 44: 455-469, 2012. First published March 6, 2012;
   doi:10.1152/physiolgenomics.00176.2011.-Keratinocyte terminal
   differentiation is the process that ultimately forms the epidermal
   barrier that is essential for mammalian survival. This process is
   controlled, in part, by signal transduction and gene expression
   mechanisms, and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is known to
   be an important regulator of multiple epidermal functions. Using
   microarray analysis of a confluent cell density-induced model of
   keratinocyte differentiation, we identified 2,676 genes that are
   regulated by epidermal growth factor (EGF), a ligand of the EGFR. We
   further discovered, and separately confirmed by functional assays, that
   EGFR activation abrogates all of the known essential processes of
   keratinocyte differentiation by 1) decreasing the expression of lipid
   matrix biosynthetic enzymes, 2) regulating numerous genes forming the
   cornified envelope, and 3) suppressing the expression of tight junction
   proteins. In organotypic cultures of skin, EGF acted to impair epidermal
   barrier integrity, as shown by increased transepidermal water loss. As
   defective epidermal differentiation and disruption of barrier function
   are primary features of many human skin diseases, we used bioinformatic
   analyses to identify genes that are known to be associated with skin
   diseases. Compared with non-EGF-regulated genes, EGF-regulated genes
   were significantly enriched for skin disease genes. These results
   provide a systems-level understanding of the actions of EGFR signaling
   to inhibit keratinocyte differentiation, providing new insight into the
   role of EGFR imbalance in skin pathogenesis.

AB The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae transcription factor Yap1 mediates an
   adaptive response to oxidative stress by regulating protective genes.
   H2O2 activates Yap1 through the Gpx3-Mediated formation of a Yap1
   Cys303-Cys598 intramolecular disulfide bond. Thiol-reactive
   electrophiles can activate Yap1 directly by adduction to cysteine
   residues in the C-terminal domain containing Cys598, Cys620, and Cys629.
   H2O2 and N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) showed no cross-protection against each
   other, whereas another thiol-reactive chemical, acrolein, elicited
   Yap1-dependent cross-protection against NEM, but not H2O2. Either Cys620
   or Cys629 was sufficient for activation of Yap1 by NEM or acrolein;
   Cys598 was dispensable for this activation mechanism. To determine
   whether Yap1 activated by H2O2 or thiol-reactive chemicals elicits
   distinct adaptive gene responses, microarray analysis was performed on
   the wild-type strain or its isogenic single-deletion strain Delta yap1
   treated with control buffer, H2O2, NEM, or acrolein. Sixty-five unique
   H2O2 and 327 NEM and acrolein Yap1-dependent responsive genes were
   identified. Functional analysis using single-gene-deletion yeast strains
   demonstrated that protection was conferred by CTA1 and CTT1 in the
   H2O2-responsive subset and YDR042C in the NEM- and acrolein-responsive
   subset. These findings demonstrate that the distinct mechanisms of Yap1
   activation by H2O2 or thiol-reactive chemicals result in selective
   expression of protective genes. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights

AB Toxicogenomics has great potential for enhancing our understanding of
   environmental chemical toxicity, hopefully leading to better informed
   human health risk assessments. This study employed toxicogenomic
   technology to reveal species differences in response to two prototypical
   aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) agonists
   2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin and the polychlorinated biphenyl
   (PCB) congener PCB 126. Dose-responses of primary cultures of rat and
   human hepatocytes were determined using species-specific microarrays
   sharing over 4000 gene orthologs. Forty-seven human and 79 rat genes
   satisfied dose-response criteria for both chemicals and were subjected
   to further analysis including the calculation of the 50% effective
   concentration and the relative potency (REP) of PCB 126 for each gene.
   Only five responsive orthologous genes were shared between the two
   species; yet, the geometric mean of the REPs for all rat and human
   modeled responsive genes were 0.06 (95% confidence interval [CI];
   0.03-0.1) and 0.002 (95% CI; 0.001-0.005), respectively, suggesting
   broad species differences in the initial events that follow AHR
   activation but precede toxicity. This indicates that there are species
   differences in both the specific genes that responded and the agonist
   potency and REP for those genes. This observed insensitivity of human
   cells to PCB 126 is consistent with more traditional measurements of AHR
   activation (i.e., cytochrome P450 1A1 enzyme activity) and suggests that
   the species difference in PCB 126 sensitivity is likely due to certain
   aspects of AHR function. That a species divergence also exists in this
   expanded AHR-regulated gene repertoire is a novel finding and should
   help when extrapolating animal data to humans.

AB 3H-1,2-dithiole-3-thione (D3T) and its analogues
   4-methyl-5-pyrazinyl-3H-1,2-dithiole-3-thione (OLT) and
   5-tert-butyl-3H-1,2-dithiole-3-thione (TBD) are chemopreventive agents
   that block or diminish early stages of carcinogenesis by inducing
   activities of detoxication enzymes. While OLT has been used in clinical
   trials, TBD has been shown to be more efficacious and possibly less
   toxic than OLT in animals. Here, we utilize a robust and high-resolution
   chemical genomics procedure to examine the pharmacological
   structure-activity relationships of these compounds in livers of male
   rats by microarray analyses. We identified 226 differentially expressed
   genes that were common to all treatments. Functional analysis identified
   the relation of these genes to glutathione metabolism and the nuclear
   factor, erythroid derived 2-related factor 2 pathway (Nrf2) that is
   known to regulate many of the protective actions of dithiolethiones. OLT
   and TBD were shown to have similar efficacies and both were weaker than
   D3T. In addition, we identified 40 genes whose responses were common to
   OLT and TBD, yet distinct from D3T. As inhibition of cytochrome P450
   (CYP) has been associated with the effects of OLT on CYP expression, we
   determined the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) values for
   inhibition of CYP1A2. The rank order of inhibitor potency was OLT > TBD
   > D3T, with IC(50) values estimated as 0.2, 12.8 and > 100 mu M,
   respectively. Functional analysis revealed that OLT and TBD, in addition
   to their effects on CYP, modulate liver lipid metabolism, especially
   fatty acids. Together, these findings provide new insight into the
   actions of clinically relevant and lead dithiolethione analogues.

AB Post hoc assignment of patterns determined by all pairwise comparisons
   in microarray experiments with multiple treatments has been proven to be
   useful in assessing treatment effects. We propose the usage of
   transitive directed acyclic graphs (tDAG) as the representation of these
   patterns and show that such representation can be useful in clustering
   treatment effects, annotating existing clustering methods, and analyzing
   sample sizes. Advantages of this approach include: (1) unique and
   descriptive meaning of each cluster in terms of how genes respond to all
   pairs of treatments; (2) insensitivity of the observed patterns to the
   number of genes analyzed; and (3) a combinatorial perspective to address
   the sample size problem by observing the rate of contractible tDAG as
   the number of replicates increases. The advantages and overall utility
   of the method in elaborating drug structure activity relationships are
   exemplified in a controlled study with real and simulated data.

AB Chronic exposure of Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats to either
   2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin ( TCDD) or Aroclor 1254 results in
   female-selective induction of hepatic tumors. The relative potency of
   dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyl mixtures, such as Aroclor 1254, is
   often estimated using the internationally endorsed toxic equivalency
   (TEQ) approach. Comparing the genome wide changes in gene expression in
   both genders following exposure to TEQ doses of these chemicals should
   identify critical sets of early response genes while further defining
   the concept of the TEQ of halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons. Aroclor
   1254 at 0.6,6.0, and 60 mg/kg body weight and TEQ doses of TCDD (0.3 and
   3.0 mu g/kg), calculated to match the top two Aroclor 1254 doses, were
   orally administered to SD rats for three consecutive days. Day 4 gene
   expression in hepatic tissue was determined using microarrays. A linear
   mixed-effects statistical model was developed to analyze the data in
   relation to treatment, gender, and gender * treatment (G*T)
   interactions. The genes most changed included 54 genes with and 51 genes
   without a significant model G*T term. The known aryl hydrocarbon
   receptor (AHR) battery genes (Cyp1a1, Cyp1a2, Cyp1b1, Aldh3a1), and
   novel genes, responded in a TEQ dose-dependent manner in both genders.
   However, an important observation was the apparent disruption of
   sexually dimorphic basal gene expression, particularly for female rats.
   Because many of these genes are involved in steroid metabolism, exposure
   to either TCDD or Aroclor 1254 could disrupt proliferative signals more
   in female rats as a possible consequence of altered estrogen metabolism.
   This study extends the findings of previous rodent bioassays by
   identifying groups of genes, other than the well-characterized AHR
   response genes, whose disruption may be important in the tumorigenic
   mechanism in this rat strain.

AB To identify distinct transcriptional patterns between the major
   subcortical dopamine targets commonly studied in addiction we studied
   differences in gene expression between the bed nucleus of the stria
   terminalis (BNST), nucleus accumbens (NAc), and dorsal striatum (dStr)
   using microarray analysis. We first tested for differences in expression
   of genes encoding transcripts for common neurotransmitter systems as
   well as calcium binding proteins routinely used in neuroanatomical
   delineation of brain regions. This a priori method revealed differential
   expression of corticotropin releasing hormone (Crh), the GABA
   transporter (Slc6a1), and prodynorphin (Pdyn) mRNAs as well as several
   others. Using a gene ontology tool, functional scoring analysis, and
   Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, we further identified several physiological
   pathways that were distinct among these brain regions. These two
   different analyses both identified calcium signaling, G-coupled protein
   receptor signaling, and adenylate cyclase-related signaling as
   significantly different among the BNST, NAc, and dStr. These types of
   signaling pathways play important roles in, amongst other things,
   synaptic plasticity. Investigation of differential gene expression
   revealed several instances that may provide insight into reported
   differences in synaptic plasticity between these brain regions. The
   results support other studies suggesting that crucial pathways involved
   in neurotransmission are distinct among the BNST, NAc, and dStr and
   provide insight into the potential use of pharmacological agents that
   may target region-specific signaling pathways. Furthermore, these
   studies provide a framework for future mouse-mouse comparisons of
   transcriptional profiles after behavioral/pharmacological manipulation.

AB The estrogen dependence of breast cancer has long been recognized;
   however, the role of 17 beta-estradiol (E-2) in cancer initiation was
   not known until we showed that it induces complete neoplastic
   transformation of the human breast epithelial cells MCF-10F. E2
   treatment of MCF-10F cells progressively induced high colony efficiency
   and loss of ductulogenesis in early transformed (trMCF) cells and
   invasiveness in Matrigel invasion chambers. The cells that crossed the
   chamber membrane were collected and identified as bsMCF; their subclones
   were designated bcMCF; and the cells harvested from carcinoma formation
   in severe combined immummodeficient mice were designated caMCF. These
   phenotypes correlated with gene dysregulation during the progression of
   the transformation. The highest number of dysregulated genes was
   observed in caMCF, being slightly lower in bcMCF, and lowest in trMCF.
   This order was consistent with the extent of chromosome aberrations
   (caMCF > bcMCF >>> trMCF). Chromosomal amplifications were found in
   1p36.12-pter, 5q21.1-qter, and 13q21.31-qter. Losses of the complete
   chromosome 4 and 8p11.21-23.1 were found only in tumorigenic cells. In
   tumor-derived cell lines, additional losses were found in 3p12.1-14.1,
   9p22.1-pter, and 18q11.21qter. Functional profiling of dysregulated
   genes revealed progressive changes in the integrin signaling pathway,
   inhibition of apoptosis, acquisition of tumorigenic cell surface
   markers, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. In tumorigenic cells,
   the levels of E-cadherin, epithelial membrane antigen, and various
   keratins were low and CD44E/CD24 were negative, whereas SNAI2, vimentin,
   S100A4, FN1, HRAS, transforming growth factor 01, and CD44H were high.
   The phenotypic and genomic changes triggered by estrogen exposure that
   lead normal cells to tumorigenesis confirm the role of this steroid
   hormone in cancer initiation.

AB Applying quantitative trait analysis methods to genome-wide
   microarray-derived mRNA expression phenotypes in segregating populations
   is a valuable tool in the attempt to link high-level traits to their
   molecular causes. The massive multiple-testing issues involved in
   analyzing these data make the correct level of confidence to place in
   mRNA abundance quantitative trait loci (QTL) a difficult problem. We use
   a unique resource to directly test mRNA abundance QTL replicability in
   mice: paired recombinant inbred (RI) and F-2 data sets derived from
   C57BL/6J (B6) and DBA/2J (D2) inbred strains and phenotyped using the
   same Affymetrix arrays. We have one forebrain and one striatum data set
   pair. We describe QTL replication at varying stringencies in these data.
   For instance, 78% of mRNA expression QTL (eQTL) with genome-wide
   adjusted p <= 0.0001 in RI data replicate at a genome-wide adjusted p <
   0.05 or better. Replicated QTL are disproportionately putatively
   cis-acting, and approximately 75% have higher apparent expression levels
   associated with B6 genotypes, which may be partly due to probe set
   generation using B6 sequence. Finally, we note that while trans-acting
   QTL do not replicate well between data sets in general, at least one
   cluster of trans-acting QTL on distal Chr 1 is notably preserved between
   data sets.
