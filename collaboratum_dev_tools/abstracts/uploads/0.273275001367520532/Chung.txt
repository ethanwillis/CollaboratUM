AB Several clinical studies have reported that an increase in excretion of
   tryptophan metabolites 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3-OHAA), anthranilic
   acid (AA) and other metabolites in the urine of bladder cancer patients
   are implicated to play a role in the etiology of bladder cancer; however
   the mechanisms involved are unknown. The present study compares the
   genotoxicity of tryptophan metabolites AA and 3-OHAA to cause
   mutagenesis in vitro. The DNA damage effects of tryptophan metabolites
   were analyzed using plasmid relaxation assay performed with AA and
   3-OHAA at various concentrations between 50 mu M and 400 mu M in the
   presence of plasmid DNA pSP-72. Both AA and 3-OHAA did not show any
   plasmid relaxation activity when tested alone. However, 3-OHAA in the
   presence of metal cofactor Cu (II) induced plasmid relaxation by causing
   nicks in the plasmid. This effect was not observed in the presence of
   other metal cofactors Fe (II) and Mn (III). Cu (Mat increasing
   concentrations between 5 mu M and 20 mu M and in the presence of 100 mu
   M 3-OHAA showed an apparent dose-response in causing DNA strand breaks.
   The Cu (II) mediated mutagenic activation of 3-OHAA was further
   investigated using Ames Salmonella/microsome mutagenicity assay with
   reactive oxygen species (ROS) sensitive tester strain Salmonella TA102.
   When 100 mu g of 3-OHAA per plate was incubated with Cu (II) a
   significant increase in TA102 revertants was observed with an increase
   in the concentration of Cu (II) from 2.5 mu g to 50 mu g. In contrast, M
   with Cu (II) at such low concentration was unable to cause any
   significant increase in number of the TA102 revertants. This evidence
   for mutagenicity with only 3-OHAA and Cu (II) but not M suggests the
   presence of hydroxyl group at ortho position to amino group in 3-OHAA
   structurally, is critical in reacting with Cu (II) to generate
   genotoxicity. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Tryptophan is metabolized through serotonin, indole, and kynurenine (KN)
   pathways. Uptake of an excess amount of tryptophan accompanied with
   vitamin B6 deficiency may result in the accumulation of higher
   concentrations of metabolites mainly from the KN pathways in the
   bladder. These metabolites could interact with nitrite to become
   mutagenic nitrosamines. They could be a promoter in the
   initiator-promoter model of carcinogenesis. They produced bladder cancer
   when implanted in the bladder. They also interact with transition metals
   copper or iron to form reactive radicals or reactive oxygen species
   (ROS). Some metabolites, 3-hydroxy-anthranilic acid, were autooxidized
   to mutagenic cinnabarinic and anthranilyl radical intermediates. These
   radical intermediates could also be ligands that interact with aryl
   hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and induce xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes
   (XMEs) to metabolize contaminated carcinogens. When tryptophan is
   exposed to either visible or UV light, a photoproduct of
   6-formylindolo[3,2b]-carbazole is formed, which has a very high affinity
   for the AhR that plays a role in carcinogenesis. This review gives an
   insight into various mechanisms through which tryptophan metabolites
   cause carcinogenesis. It could be concluded that tryptophan metabolites
   play a complementary role in promoting carcinogenesis along with
   carcinogens like aflatoxin, CCl4, 2-acetylaminofluorene,
   4-aminobiphenyl, 2-naphthylamine, or N-[4-(5-nitro-2-furyl)
   22-thiazolyl] formamide. The underlying mechanisms could be their
   autoxidation, exposure to either visible or UV light, interaction with
   nitrite or transition metals to form reactive intermediates, serving as
   ligands to interact with an AhR that is known to play a role in
   carcinogenesis through induction of XMEs. Further research is warranted.

AB Temozolomide (TMZ) is an oral alkylating agent that has been widely used
   in the treatment of refractory glioma, although inherent and acquired
   resistance to this drug is common. The clinical use of valproic acid
   (VPA) as an anticonvulsant and mood-stabilizing drug has been reported
   primarily for the treatment of epilepsy and bipolar disorder and less
   commonly for major depression. VPA is also used in the treatment of
   glioma-associated seizures with or without intracranial operation. In
   this study, we evaluated the potential synergistic effect of TMZ and VPA
   in human glioma cell lines. Compared with the use of TMZ or VPA alone,
   concurrent treatment with both drugs synergistically induced apoptosis
   in U87MG cells as evidenced by p53 and Bax expression, mitochondrial
   transmembrane potential loss, reactive oxygen species production, and
   glutathione depletion. This synergistic effect correlated with a
   decrease in nuclear translocation of the nuclear factor-erythroid 2
   p45-related factor and corresponded with reduced heme oxygenasc-1 and
   gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase expression. Pretreatment with
   N-acetylcysteine partially recovered the apoptotic effect of the TMZ/VPA
   combination treatment. The same degree of synergism is also seen in
   p53-mutant Hs683 cells, which indicates that p53 may not play a major
   role in the increased proapoptotic effect of the TMZ/VPA combination. In
   conclusion, VPA enhanced the apoptotic effect of TMZ, possibly through a
   redox regulation mechanism. The TMZ/VPA combination may be effective for
   treating glioma cancer and may be a powerful agent against malignant
   glioma. This drug combination should be further explored in the clinical
   setting.

AB Calvatia lilacina (CL), Pleurotus ostreatus (PO) and Volvariella
   volvacea (VV) are widely distributed worldwide and commonly eaten as
   mushrooms. In this study, cell viabilities were evaluated for a human
   colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line (SW480 cells) and a human monocytic
   leukemia cell line (THP-1 cells). Apoptotic mechanisms induced by the
   protein extracts of PO and VV were evaluated for SW480 cells. The
   viabilities of THP-1 and SW480 cells decreased in a
   concentration-dependent manner after 24 h of treatment with the protein
   extracts of CL, PO or VV. Apoptosis analysis revealed that the
   percentage of SW480 cells in the SubG(1) phase (a marker of apoptosis)
   was increased upon PO and VV protein-extract treatments, indicating that
   oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation existed concomitantly with cellular
   death. The PO and VV protein extracts induced reactive oxygen species
   (ROS) production, glutathione (GSH) depletion and mitochondrial
   transmembrane potential (Delta Psi(m)) loss in SW480 cells. Pretreatment
   with N-acetylcysteine, GSH or cyclosporine A partially prevented the
   apoptosis induced by PO protein extracts, but not that induced by VV
   extracts, in SW480 cells. The protein extracts of CL, PO and VV
   exhibited therapeutic efficacy against human colorectal adenocarcinoma
   cells and human monocytic leukemia cells. The PO protein extracts
   induced apoptosis in SW480 cells partially through ROS production, GSH
   depletion and mitochondrial dysfunction. Therefore, the protein extracts
   of these mushrooms could be considered an important source of new
   anti-cancer drugs.

AB Quercetin (QT) and Taxifolin (TF) are structurally similar plant
   polyphenols. Both have been reported to have therapeutic potential as
   anti-cancer drugs and antioxidants. Mutagenic effects of QT and TF were
   evaluated using Salmonella typhimurium TA102 and Escherichia coli WP-2
   uvrA tester strains. Either in the presence or absence of S9 mix, QT was
   mutagenic to TA102 and WP2 uvrA. However, the mutagenicity of QT was
   significantly enhanced in the presence of S9 mix. Likewise, in the
   presence of Iron (Fe2+) and NADPH generating system (NGS) and absence of
   S9 mix, QT induced significantly high mutations in both TA102 and WP-2
   uvrA. Mutagenicity of QT decreased in both strains in the presence of
   Iron (Fe2+) or NGS alone. TF was not mutagenic in the presence or
   absence of S9 mix in both TA 102 and WP-2 uvrA 2, regardless of the
   presence of iron or NGS. Incorporation of antioxidants (ascorbate,
   superoxide dismutose (SOD), catalase (CAT)) and/or iron chelators
   (desferroxamine (DF) and ethylenediamine-tetraacetate (EDTA)) in the
   test systems markedly decreased QT-induced mutations in both tester
   strains. These results suggest that QT but not TF, could induce
   mutations in the presence or absence of rat liver S9 or Iron (Fe2+) and
   NGS in both tester strains by redox cycling and Fenton reactions to
   produce oxygen free radicals. Our results indicate that a minor
   structural variation between the two plant polyphenols could elicit a
   marked difference in their genotoxicities. These results provide a basis
   for further study into the potential use of QT in combination with iron
   supplements. Environ. Mal. Mutagen. 50:451-459, 2009. (C) 2009

AB This paper reports that a novel protein extract isolated from Calvatia
   Iilacina (CL) can induce cell death against four types of human
   colorectal cancer cells. Importantly, CL was shown to be free of
   apoptotic effects against normal rat liver cells. We have also
   identified that CL-induced glutathione (GSH) depletion is the major
   contributor responsible for the apoptotic cell death induction of SW 480
   cells, as evidencd by the observation that exogenously added
   N-acetylcysteine (NAC), or GSH, but not vitamin C, could offer a near
   complete protection of CL-treated cells against apoptotic cell death.
   Furthermore, the participation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) evoked a
   drop in the transmembrane potential (Delta Psi(m),) in the CL-induced
   apoptotic cell death. This observation can only be deemed as a minor
   pathway due to the fact that cyclosporine A (CyA) could only partially
   rescue the CL-treated cells from apoptotic cell death. Likewise, despite
   the fact that CL could induce the upregulation of Bax, its knockdown via
   siRNA (48 h) failed to completely mitigate apoptotic cell death,
   indicating that its role in this apoptotic process was insignificant. To
   further explore the possible underlying mechanism associated with
   CL-induced GSH depletion, we proceeded to determine the effect of CL on
   the cellular gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (gamma-GCS), a
   rate-limiting enzyme responsible for GSH biosynthesis, and demonstrated
   that indeed gamma-GCS could be repressed by CL. Taken together, we
   report here for the first time that the anticancer effect of CL on human
   colorectal cancer cells is mediated through GSH depletion mechanism
   rather than a ROS-mediated killing process. This functional attribute of
   CL can thus provide the basis for the strategic design of a treatment of
   colorectal cancer.

AB Baicalein, one of the major flavones, was found to be responsible for
   the antioxidative activity of the traditional Chinese medicinal herb
   Huang-Qin (Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi), which is widely used as an
   antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and antitumor agent. The hydroxyl
   group of the A ring of the baicalein was alkylated at position 6 with
   terpenoids such as prenyl, geranyl, and farnesyl groups, and - their
   free radical scavenging activities and glutathione (GSH) depletion
   capacities were examined. Their free radical scavenging activity was
   measured according to the
   2,2'-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS(.+))
   scavenging method. Baicalein and newly synthesized baicalein derivatives
   were found to be good free radical scavengers. Flow cytometrical method
   was employed to measure the intracellular antioxidative activity and GSH
   depletion capacity of these derivatives in human acute monocytic
   leukemia cell line (THP-1). It was also found that baicalein and its
   derivatives could decrease the levels of exogenous cumene hydroperoxide
   and H(2)O(2) in THP-1 cells. These compounds also could significantly
   inhibit the intracellular GSH depletion induced by cumene hydroperoxide
   in THP-1 cells. The production of cumene hydroperoxide-induced Bax, a
   pro-apoptotic related protein, could also be inhibited by baicalein and
   its derivatives. These results suggested that baicalein and its
   derivatives could be beneficial to human health.

AB Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an important opportunistic pathogen of the
   human urinary bladder. Similar to rat liver S9, the cell-free extract
   from P. aeruginosa caused significant increase of histidine reversion
   numbers with the Salmonella typhimurium tester strain TA98 in the Ames
   Salmonella mutagenicity assay in the presence of either 2-aminofluorene,
   4-aminobiphenyl, or benzidine procarcinogens. The presence of cytochrome
   P-450 protein in the cell-free extract was demonstrated by the carbon
   monoxide difference spectrum. We employed gene knockout technology to
   inactivate one of the three known putative cytochrome P-450 genes of P.
   aeruginosa, namely CYP107S1, which we postulated to be the most likely
   to induce activation. The ampicillin resistant gene from PUC19 DNA
   confers carbenicillin resistance to P. aeruginosa. We inserted a
   synthetic ampicillin gene flanked by 40 base-pairs of the 5' and 3'
   untranslated region of the CYP gene by electroporating the synthetic
   gene into electrocompetent P. aeruginosa cells. CYPI07S1 knockout
   strains were selected on 1000 mu g/ml carbenicillin plates. A single
   cloned carbenicillin resistant colony was isolated and used to determine
   its mutagenic capacity using Ames Salmonella mutagenicity assay. The
   results showed that Salmonella TA98 tester strain returned the number of
   revertants to its baselines level indicating the lack of metabolic
   activation of procarcinogens in the P. aeruginosa CYPI07S1 knockout
   cell-free extract. In addition, the characteristic cytochrome P-450 peak
   determined by the carbon monoxide difference spectrum was completely
   absent in the cell-free extract from this CYPI07S1 knockout strain
   bacterium. Homologous recombination of the synthetic ampicillin gene on
   the CYP 107S1 P-450 locus was confirmed by PCR on purified genomic DNA
   extracted from the knockout bacterium. The metabolic activation of
   tested procarcinogens is, therefore, carried out by CYPI07S1 in P.
   aeruginosa. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Benzidine (Bz), a human bladder carcinogen, was strongly mutagenic to
   Salmonella TA102 tester strain in the Ames Salmonella
   microsome/mutagenicity assay in the presence of rat liver S9 mix.
   Various non-mutagenic plant polyphenols were included in the assay to
   test their inhibitory effects on the Bz-induced mutations. Coumestrol,
   ellagic acid (EA), (-)-epicatechin (EC), (-)-epichatechingallate (ECG),
   gallic acid (GA), (-)-gallocatechin (GC), plumbagin, propyl gallate
   (PG), taxifolin, and 2,2,4'-trihydroxychalcone were found to have a
   strong inhibitory effect on Bz-induced mutations.
   (-)-Epigallo-catechingallate (EGCG), fisetin, (-)-gallocatechingallate
   (GCG), and piceatannol were moderately inhibitory to the mutations;
   whereas, (-)-catechin, (-)-catechingallate (CG), and reseveratrol were
   weakly inhibitory to the mutations. (-)-Epigallocatechin (EGC) and
   7,3',4'-trihydroxy isoflavon were not inhibitory to the Bz-induced
   mutations. Isoliquirtigenin, quercetin dihydrate, and rhein were found
   to be mutagenic in tester strain TA102. Benzidine mediated lipid
   peroxidation was conducted employing the thiobarbituric acid reactive
   substances (TBARS) assay using linoleic acid as a substrate. In the
   presence of rat liver S9 mix, Bz could cause lipid peroxidation as an
   outcome of production of oxygen free radicals. Incorporation of the
   above mentioned non-mutagenic plant polyphenols significantly inhibited
   benzidine mediated lipid peroxidation in a time dependent manner. These
   polyphenols also effectively reduced the iron mediated lipid
   peroxidation. Thus, it is concluded that the inhibition of oxidative
   mutagenicity of Bz by plant polyphenols could be due to an inhibitory
   effect of plant polyphenols on the bioactivating enzymes such as
   cytochrome P-450 and peroxidase and the chelation of iron present in the
   cytochrome P-450 in the S9 mix. Thus, these plant polyphenols play a
   significant inhibitory role on Bz-induced mutagenicity. (c) 2007

   The mutagenicity of these compounds was tested in the presence and

   tester strain TA102, which is sensitive to agents producing reactive
   oxygen species (ROS). In the presence of S9, 4-Ab, Bz,

   in TA102, whereas, 3,3',5,5'-tetra-methylbenzidine,

   4,4'-dinitro-2-biphenylamine were directly mutagenic in TA102.
   Incorporation of the free radical and metal scavengers, catalase,
   superoxide dismutase (SOD), butylated hydroxytolune (BHT), and
   ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) reduced the mutagenic responses
   of 4-Ab and Bz, whereas heat-inactivated catalase and SOD had no effect.
   4-Ab and Bz also induced lipid peroxidation in the presence of S9 mix as
   shown using the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances assay. The
   results of this study indicate that 4-Ab and Bz induce mutations through

   extracts of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter
   aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus
   epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and
   intestinal anaerobes, Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, and
   Eubacterium aerofaciens produced increased histidine revertant
   frequencies with the tester strain Salmonella typhimurium TA98 in the
   Ames Salmonella mutagenicity assay. In addition, the cell-free extracts
   of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis, and Eubacterium
   aerofaciens each showed the presence of a cytochrome P450 absorption
   peak in the carbon monoxide (CO) difference spectrum. This was not
   demonstratable for the other bacteria. Our findings indicate that human
   endogenous bacteria, which are opportunistic pathogens of the urinary
   bladder, can metabolically activate the bladder procarcinogens 2-AF,
   4-AB, and Bz into mutagens. The metabolic activation by Pseudomonas
   aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis, and Eubacterium aerofaciens is
   mediated by a cytochrome P450 enzyme. For those organisms that induced
   metabolic activation but did not show a P450 absorption peak with the
   cell-free extracts, other oxidative enzymes may be involved. (c) 2005

   the Salmonella/microsome mutagenicity assay. Many of these amines are
   mutagenic in tester strains TA98 and TA100 but require exogenous
   mammalian activation 69) for activity. A few amines with halogen or
   nitro-groups in the structure are direct-acting mutagens. The addition
   of a sulfonic acid moiety to the molecule of benzidine reduced the
   mutagenicity of benzidine; whereas, methoxy, chloro, or methyl group
   additions did not. Complexation with a metal ion also decreased (lie
   mutagenicity. A substitution of an alkyl group on the ortho position
   next to an amine group also influenced the mutagenicity, Most
   carcinogenic benzidine analogues are mutagenic, and their metabolism to
   electrophiles that interact with DNA, leading to Mutations, plays a
   central role in their carcinogenesis. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Experiments were conducted to study the effect of a dietary supplement
   of dehulled adlay (Coix lachryma-jobi L, var, ma-yuen Stapf) on the
   culture counts of some important groups of intestinal bacteria and their
   metabolism in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of Sprague-Dawley rats.
   Rats were divided into four groups, and each group was fed a diet
   containing different levels of dehulled adlay for 30 days as follows: 0%
   (control), 5%, 20%, and 40%. All animals fed with adlay had normal
   healthy intestinal walls and no pathogenic signs whatsoever. There were
   no significant differences in body weight gain or the cecal-pH between
   different groups of rats. Both the 20% and 40% groups had lower culture
   counts of enterics in their feces than the 5% and control groups,
   whereas the culture counts of fecal lactic acid bacteria were higher in
   feces of rats fed with adlay than in the control group. Cecal total
   short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) content and fecal SCFA were significantly
   higher in the 20% and 40% groups than in the control and 5% groups. All
   the adlay-fed rats had a higher fecal butyric acid concentration than
   the control rats. It is concluded that adlay has a significant influence
   on the growth of intestinal bacteria, which may ultimately affect the
   physiology and other functions of GI tracts of rats.

   concentrations (MICs) of gallic acid, methyl gallate, and propyl gallate
   were lower in natural pond water than in modified Shieh medium, whereas
   the MIC of tannic acid was the same in both. Tannic acid, a polymeric

AB Monocyclic aromatic amines (MAAs) are environmental pollutants. Many of
   them are genotoxic and impose hazards to human health, The mutagenicity
   of more than 80 of these amines was reviewed with primary emphasis on
   evaluation by the Ames Salmonella/microsome testing system. Many amines
   are mutagenic in Salmonella tester strains TA98 and TA100, but S9 mix is
   required for activity for most of the active ones. 2,4-Diaminotoluene,
   2,4-diaminoethylbenzene, and a few amines containing a nitro-group are
   direct mutagens. There are several quantitative structure-activity
   relationship (QSAR) models which rationalize mutagenicity of many
   aromatic amines and several parameters, such as the lowest unoccupied
   molecular orbital energy (E-LUMO), highest occupied molecular orbital
   energy (E-HOMO), and hydrophobicity that are important. What factors
   determine the minimum requirement for the compound to be mutagenic and
   what factors determine the extent of mutagenicity suggest questions for

AB Benzamines are the major aromatic amines used in industry and can also
   be released from azo dyes, which are widely used in the textile,
   paper-making, and food industries. The toxicity of 10 benzamines was
   tested by the well diffusion assay technique against 18 common bacterial
   species including the nitrogen-fixing bacterium Azotobacter vinelandii.
   p-Phenylenediamine was found to be inhibitory to the growth of Aeromonas
   hydrophila and Pseudomonas fluorescens. o-Phenylenediamine was
   inhibitory to Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pnemoniae, Salmonella
   enteritidis, and Shigella sonnei. 2,5-Diaminotoluene was inhibitory to
   the growth of P. fluorescens and Streptococcus mitis. The growth of A.
   vinelandii was inhibited by p-phenylenediamine and 2,5-diaminotoluene in
   the well diffusion assay. p-Nitroaniline was also found to be inhibitory
   to the growth of A. vinelandii in Burk's nitrogen-free medium. The
   nitrogenase activity of A. vinelandii was inhibited by
   p-phenylenediamine, 2,5-diaminotoluene, p-nitroaniline,
   2-nitro-p-phenylenediamine, 3-nitro-o-phenylenediamine, and
   4-nitro-o-phenylenediamine. Because many of these organisms are common
   soil and aquatic bacteria, the accumulation of these benzamine compounds
   in the environment may have an adverse impact on soil biochemical
   activities.

AB Dietary restriction (DR) alters the activities of hepatic drug
   metabolizing enzymes and modulates the formation of carcinogen-DNA
   adducts in carcinogen treated animals. Our previous results showed that
   a 40% restriction of diet (60% of ad libitum (AL) food consumption)
   reduced the hepatic metabolic activation of aflatoxin B-1 (AFB(1)) but
   increased the activation of benzo[a]-pyrene (BaP) in both rats and mice.
   In this study, the focus was directed toward the levels of
   carcinogen-DNA adducts formation and the carcinogen-induced DNA strand
   breaks in mouse kidney and liver DNA. DR significantly inhibited both
   AFB(1)-DNA adduct formation and AFB(1)-induced DNA strand breaks in
   kidney DNA of mice that received a single dose of [H-3]AFB(1) (5 mg/kg).
   The levels of AFB(1)-DNA adduct formation in mouse kidney DNA correlated
   well with increased AFB(1)-induced DNA strand breaks. The correlation
   between the levels of AFB(1)-DNA-adducts formed and DNA strand breaks in
   kidney DNA of DR-mice was less linear than between its AL-counterpart
   suggesting that other factors, such as different rates of DNA repair,
   may be involved. In addition, DR enhanced hepatic BaP- and
   6-nitrochrysene (6-NC)-DNA adduct formation in the mice treated with BaP
   and 6-NC, respectively. The formation of the specific BaP-adduct,
   10-(N-2-deoxyguanosinyl)-7,8,9-trihydroxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydro-BaP
   (N-2-dG-BaP), in mouse liver was proportional to the dose, and was
   compatible to the BaP-induced DNA strand breaks affected by DR. The
   enhancement of the total 6-NC-DNA adduct formation in DR-mouse was also
   in correlation with the increased 6-NC-induced DNA strand breaks. The
   activity of mouse liver microsomal nitro-reductase increased by 2-fold
   in response to DR indicating that the nitroreduction may contribute to
   the increase of the metabolic activation of 6-NC. Our present results
   indicate that the effect of DR on the carcinogen activation is dependent
   upon the DR-modulated carcinogen metabolizing enzyme activities. (C)

AB Hepatic microsomal xenobiotic metabolizing enzyme activities of
   laboratory animals can be modulated by Dietary restriction (DR). The
   modulation of xenobiotic metabolizing enzyme activities can affect the
   metabolic activation of chemical carcinogens. Acute DR (60% of the food
   consumption of ad libitum (AL)-fed mice for 7 weeks) reduced the body
   weights of the male B6C3F(1) mice, and increased mouse pulmonary
   cytochrome P4501A1-dependent BaP metabolizing enzyme activity. The
   effects of DR on the formation of the specific BaP-DNA adduct,
   10-(N-2-deoxyguanosinyl)-7,8,9-trihydroxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydro-BaP
   (BaP-N-2-dG) in mouse lung can be detected by using P-32-postlabeling
   technique. In both AL and DR-mice total BaP-DNA adduct formation in lung
   reached a peak at 48 hours after treatment with [H-3]BaP and the in vivo
   formation of BaP-N-2-dG was greater in DR mouse lung than in that of
   AL-animals by 22%. DR increased in vitro BaP-N-2-dG formation by 39%
   when calf-thymus DNA was incubated with BaP using liver microsomes
   obtained from DR- or AL-mice as the enzyme source. The formation of the
   specific BaP-N-2-dG adducts, measured by P-32-postlabeling, was only 20%
   of the total [H-3]BaP-DNA adducts as determined by liquid scintillation
   counting. The increase of BaP-DNA adduct formation in mouse lung was
   correlated to the enhancement of the mouse pulmonary BaP metabolizing
   enzyme activity. Our results indicated that the effect of DR on the
   metabolic activation of BaP in mouse lung was dependent upon the mouse
   lung cytochrome P4501A1-dependent BaP metabolizing enzymes activities
   which was significantly increased by DR.

AB The Ames Salmonella/microsomal assay was employed to test the
   mutagenicity of some benzamines (aniline, and o- and p-phenylenediamine)
   and their nitro-derivatives (p-nitroaniline,
   2-nitro-p-phenylene-diamine, 3- and 4-nitro-o-phenylenediamine), using
   strains TA98 and TA100 and their nitroreductase-deficient mutants,
   TA98NR and TA100NR, in the presence and absence of rat S9 mix. The
   addition of the nitro-group to benzamine molecules converted them into
   direct mutagens. Furthermore, the position of the nitro-group affected
   their mutagenic activities. Cytotoxicity testing with Chinese hamster
   ovary cells (CHO-K1) showed that the presence of the nitro-group in
   these compounds had no specific effect on toxicity. The test compounds
   all showed a dose-related increase in inducing chromosomal aberrations
   in CHO cells. However, the presence of the nitro-group did not affect
   potency in inducing chromosomal aberrations. Compounds containing the
   nitro-group had higher initial oxidation potentials and dipole moments
   (mu) than their nonnitro-containing counterparts. The mutagenicity and
   toxicity of these compounds were not related to physicochemical
   properties, including oxidation potential, energy difference (Delta E)
   between the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and the highest
   occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), ionization potential (I.P.), and mu.

AB Dietary restriction (DR) reduced the metabolic activation of aflatoxin
   B1 (AFB(1)) in rats, This reduction may be attributed to the decrease of
   cytochrome P-450-mediated AFB(1) epoxidation and/or increase in the
   detoxification of AFB(1) catalyzed by hepatic glutathione S-transferase
   (GST) and other phase II detoxification enzymes. In this study the
   effect of DR on male rat liver cytosolic GST activity toward
   AFB(1)-8,9-epoxide was studied. The chemically-synthesized
   AFB(1)-8,9-epoxide was used as the substrate in this assay, and the
   formation of AFB(1)-GSH conjugate was analyzed by HPLC. Male Fischer 344
   rats fed DR diets (60% of the food consumption of ad libitum (AL)-fed
   rats) showed a 2.4-fold increase in GST activity when AFB(1)-epoxide was
   used as the substrate. The results from the enzyme kinetic study showed
   that DR increased V-max of the liver cytosolic GST but not the K-m.
   Acute DR has little or no impact on GST activity when
   1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene and 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene were used as
   substrates. The mouse liver GST activity toward AFB(1)-epoxide was
   3-fold greater than that of phenobarbital-induced rats, 4.5-fold greater
   than DR rats, and 14.7-fold greater than the GST activity of AL rats,
   This direct assay of liver GST activity using AFB(1)-epoxide as the
   substrate is useful for studying AFB(1)-induced biomarkers, such as
   AFB(1)-GSH conjugation and AFB(1)-DNA adducts.

AB Nostoc sp. strain MAC, a filamentous cyanobacterium, produces the
   compound geosmin, which causes off-flavor in commercially produced
   catfish. Tannic acid, propyl gallate, and gallic acid inhibited growth
   and pigment synthesis in both MAC and Agmenellum quadruplicatum strain
   PR-6, a cyanobacterium that does not cause off-flavor. These compounds
   were inhibitory in both laboratory growth media and in pond water
   augmented with growth medium, as demonstrated by disk agar diffusion
   assay. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of tannic acid, propyl
   gallate, and gallic acid in augmented pond water were respectively 320,
   240, and 500 mu-g/disk for MAC and 20, 40, and 20 mu-g/disk for PR-6.
   Methyl gallate at a minimum inhibitory concentration of 80 mu-m/disk was
   active against PR-6 but was entirely inactive against MAC. Strain PR-6
   was more susceptible to these chemicals than was strain MAC.

AB The effect of caloric restriction (CR) on xenobiotic metabolizing enzyme
   activities results in alterations in the metabolic activation of
   chemical carcinogens, with a resultant impact on DNA-carcinogen adduct
   formation and DNA repair. Using aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) and benzo[a]pyrene
   (BP) as model carcinogens, we studied the effect of CR on the metabolic
   activation of these carcinogens and carcinogen-induced DNA damage and
   repair in terms of AFB1-DNA and BP-DNA adduct formation and removal.
   Male Fischer 344 rats fed calorie restricted diets (60% of the food
   consumption for ad libitum-fed rats) showed a reduction in the metabolic
   activation of AFB1 and decrease in both the in vitro and in vivo
   AFB1-DNA adduct formation. However, CR increased the activity of BP
   metabolizing enzymes resulting in an enhancement of BP-DNA adduct
   formation. Our results indicate that the effect of CR on metabolic
   activation of xenobiotics is dependent upon the selected xenobiotic
   metabolizing enzymes whose activities may be significantly altered by
   CR, and upon the nature of the chemical carcinogens which exert
   different structure-activity relationships during the process of
   chemically induced carcinogenesis.

AB The degradation of azo dyes by environmental microorganisms, fungi, and
   helminths is reviewed. Azo dyes are used in a wide variety of products
   and can be found in the effluent of most sewage treatment facilities.
   Substantial quantities of these dyes have been deposited in the
   environment, particularly in streams and rivers. Azo dyes were shown to
   affect microbial activities and microbial population sizes in the
   sediments and in the water columns of aquatic habitats. Only a few
   aerobic bacteria have been found to reduce azo dyes under aerobic
   conditions, and little is known about the process. A substantial number
   of anaerobic bacteria capable of azo dye reduction have been reported.
   The enzyme responsible for azo dye reduction has been partially
   purified, and characterization of the enzyme is proceeding. The nematode
   Ascaris lumbricoides and the cestode Moniezia expansa have been reported
   to reduce azo dyes anaerobically. Recently the fungus Phanerochaete
   chrysosporium was reported to mineralize azo dyes via a
   peroxidation-mediated pathway. A possible degradation pathway for the
   mineralization of azo dyes is proposed and future research needs are
   discussed.
