AB A clinical need continues for consistent bone remodeling within
   problematic sites such as those of fracture nonunion, avascular
   necrosis, or irregular bone formations. In attempt to address such
   needs, a biomaterial system is proposed to induce early inflammatory
   responses after implantation and to provide later osteoconductive
   scaffolding for bone regeneration. Biomaterial-induced inflammation
   would parallel the early stage of hematoma-induced fracture repair and
   allow scaffold-promoted remodeling of osseous tissue to a healthy state.
   Initiation of the wound healing cascade by two human concentrated
   platelet releasate-containing alginate/beta-tricalcium phosphate
   biocomposites has been studied in vitro using the TIB-71 (TM) RAW264.7
   mouse monocyte cell line. Inflammatory responses inherent to the base
   material were found and could be modulated through incorporation of
   platelet releasate. Differences in hydrogel wt% (2 vs. 8 %) and/or
   calcium phosphate granule vol.% (20 vs. 10 %) allowed for tuning the
   response associated with platelet releasate-associated growth factor
   elution. Tunability from completely suppressing the inflammatory
   response to augmenting the response was observed through varied elution
   profiles of both releasate-derived bioagents and impurities inherent to
   alginate. A 2.5-fold upregulation of inducible-nitric oxide synthase
   gene expression followed by a tenfold increase in nitrite media levels
   was induced by inclusion of releasate within the 8 wt%/10 vol.%
   formulation and was comparable to an endotoxin positive control.
   Whereas, near complete elimination of inflammation was seen when
   releasate was included within the 2 wt%/20 vol.% formulation. These in
   vitro results suggested tunable interactions between the multiple
   platelet releasate-derived bioagents and the biocomposites for enhancing
   hematoma-like fracture repair. Additionally, minimally invasive delivery
   for in situ curing of the implant system via injection was demonstrated
   in rat tail vertebrae using microcomputed tomography.

AB A significant gap exists in our understanding of subchondral and
   cancellous bone changes that may regulate osteoarthritis progression.
   Herein, we complement our prior osteochondrogenesis work with growth
   factor elution and monocyte and endothelial cell activation using two
   biomaterial formulations. The design of these biomaterials was inspired
   by the roles of a fracture hematoma, more specifically, the potential of
   significant cross-talk among cells and cellular factors that affect bone
   remodeling. Biomaterials, referred to herein as F1+ and F2+, are human
   concentrated platelet releasate-containing alginate/beta-tricalcium
   phosphate composites. F1+ has a higher calcium phosphate volume
   percentage and lower alginate polymer weight percent hydrogel versus
   F2+. The majority of releasate-derived platelet-derived growth factor
   eluted over 24 h for F1+ and 48 h for F2+, suggesting sustained release
   with an increase in alginate weight percentage. Simple monocyte and
   endothelial cell migration studies demonstrated 650% and 900% increases
   with F1+ eluate over medium alone, respectively. Induction of
   endothelial cell invasion over supplemented medium positive control was
   also shown for F2+ eluate (p = 0.03) with F1+ eluate being similar to
   the control. Monocyte transendothelial migration was increased over 300%
   and 400% for F1+ and F2+ eluates compared with medium alone,
   respectively. In addition, F1+ and F2+ eluates induced spontaneous
   endothelial tube formations similar to supplemented medium,
   demonstrating a well-formed network of capillary-like structures. This
   work demonstrated our biomaterial formulations ability to induce
   characteristics in vitro that parallel the in vivo behavior of fracture
   hematomas and potential to induce bone remodeling for the early
   treatment of osteoarthritic joints. (C) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J

AB Background: Polymer crosslinked aerogels are an attractive class of
   materials for future implant applications particularly as a biomaterial
   for the support of nerve growth. The low density and nano-porous
   structure of this material combined with large surface area, high
   mechanical strength, and tunable surface properties, make aerogels
   materials with a high potential in aiding repair of injuries of the
   peripheral nervous system. However, the interaction of neurons with
   aerogels remains to be investigated.
   Methodology: In this work the attachment and growth of neurons on clear
   polyurea crosslinked silica aerogels (PCSA) coated with: poly-L-lysine,
   basement membrane extract (BME), and laminin1 was investigated by means
   of optical and scanning electron microscopy. After comparing the
   attachment and growth capability of neurons on these different coatings,
   laminin1 and BME were chosen for nerve cell attachment and growth on
   PCSA surfaces. The behavior of neurons on treated petri dish surfaces
   was used as the control and behavior of neurons on treated PCSA discs
   was compared against it.
   Conclusions/Significance: This study demonstrates that: 1) untreated
   PCSA surfaces do not support attachment and growth of nerve cells, 2) a
   thin application of laminin1 layer onto the PCSA discs adhered well to
   the PCSA surface while also supporting growth and differentiation of
   neurons as evidenced by the number of processes extended and b3-tubulin
   expression, 3) three dimensional porous structure of PCSA remains intact
   after fixing protocols necessary for preservation of biological samples
   and 4) laminin1 coating proved to be the most effective method for
   attaching neurons to the desired regions on PCSA discs. This work
   provides the basis for potential use of PCSA as a biomaterial scaffold
   for neural regeneration.

AB Underlying changes in subchondral and cancellous bone precede joint
   degeneration in spinal discs, knees, hips, and other joints. We
   hypothesize that an early bone remodeling intervention therapy may
   alleviate or postpone the later manifestation of joint failure.
   Utilization of a novel biomaterial for injection deliverability to the
   underlying subchondral and cancellous bone during the onset of osseous
   changes, before severe cartilaginous damage, is proposed. In this
   preliminary study, we introduced novel platelet releasate-containing
   alginate/calcium phosphate composites for this intervention therapy and
   evaluated them in vitro through mesenchymal stem cell biocompatibility
   and induction of osteochondral differentiation. DNA quantification and
   gene expression profiles suggested mesenchymal stem cells were directed
   along an osteochondral differentiation pathway, more specifically, to
   the immature nonhypertrophic chondrocyte phenotype. These conclusions
   were based on reduced mitogenic activity, a rapid upregulation followed
   by suppression of Runx2 transcription factor mRNA, sustained
   upregulation of Sox9 transcription factor mRNA and the absence of late
   marker expressions for both mature articular chondrocytes and
   osteoblasts over the course of 14 days. Initial findings in regard to
   the use of these materials for bone remodeling were positive and support
   the execution of future studies evaluating the inflammatory and
   angiogenic aspects of the materials. In this study, we have considered
   one of the many aspects of the endochondral ossification process;
   neovascularization and resorption of bone with an irregular physiology
   need to be evaluated. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed Mater

AB Study Design. Using a low cell density, hypoxic, alginate-bead culture
   system, the effects of bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) and
   synthetic peptide B2A on cell proliferation and extracellular matrix
   (ECM) synthesis were assessed at days 0, 3, 5, and 7, using nucleus
   pulposus (NP)-like differentiated mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs).
   Objective. This is a preliminary investigation into B2A's potential
   adjunctive role with MSCs and BMP-2, in NP regeneration.
   Summary of Background Data. B2A analogs, alone and in combination with
   BMP-2, have been shown to promote proliferation and ECM production in
   chondrocytes and MSCs. Articular chondrocytes and NP cells often respond
   in a similar manner to growth factor treatments, thus suggesting a
   potential role for B2A in treating disc degeneration by NP regeneration.
   Methods. Using the NP regeneration in vitro model (low cell density,
   hypoxic, alginate bead culture), B2A and BMP-2 were evaluated alone and
   in combination, to determine effects on proliferation and ECM synthesis
   in the presence of transforming growth factor-beta 3 on NP-like
   differentiated MSCs.
   Results. B2A administration induced mild proliferation of NP-like
   differentiated MSCs and diminished an initial wave of low-dose
   BMP-2-prompted apoptosis. Individually and in combination, B2A and BMP-2
   were found to inhibit transforming growth factor-beta 3-permitted
   collagen accumulation; levels remained similar in their presence. Both
   collagen I (Col I) and collagen II (Col II) were found in almost all
   specimens, but increased B2A levels favored Col II unlike BMP-2, which
   favored Col I. BMP-2 resulted in a minor reduction in aggrecan
   synthesis, which was unchanged by B2A.
   Conclusion. Using this in vitro model, B2A induced proliferation,
   continuous aggrecan synthesis, and stabilized collagen accumulation
   favoring Col II. These characteristics are consistent with cells of the
   young, healthy NP, indicating potential use of the peptide early in an
   MSC-based NP-regeneration therapy; whereas, BMP-2 induced apoptosis, Col
   I accumulation, and aggrecan production hindrance, and was found
   untherapeutic.

AB We studied the effects of tick saliva on cell migration, cell signaling,
   phagocytosis, and gene expression in the murine macrophage cell line,
   IC-21. Saliva increased both basal- and platelet-derived growth factor
   (PDGF)-stimulated migration in IC-21 cells. However, saliva did not
   affect PDGF-stimulated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)
   activity. Zymosan-mediated interleukin-1 receptor associated kinase
   (IRAK) activity increased when cells were pretreated with saliva. Saliva
   suppressed phagocytosis of zymosan particles by IC-21 cells. An RT(2)
   Profiler (TM) PCR Array revealed that saliva regulates gene expression
   in a manner consistent with an immune response skewed toward a Th2
   reaction, which is characterized by production of anti-inflammatory
   cytokines IL-4 and IL-10. Our results using IC-21 cells suggest that
   Dermacentor variabilis has evolved a mechanism for regulating macrophage
   function, which may contribute to the tick's ability to modulate immune
   function. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Minimally invasive subdermal injection of liquid silicone has been used
   clinically to augment the soft tissue of the foot to mitigate high
   pressures that cause diabetic foot ulcers. However, implant migration
   has been a clinical issue. The objective of this study was to assess the
   effects of three specific concentrations of silicone resin particles (12
   mu m average diameter) in conjunction with either platelet-derived
   growth factor (PDGF-BB) or basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) on
   fibroblast cell proliferation, collagen synthesis, cell morphology, and
   migration through in vitro assays and a monolayer scratch wound model.
   PDGF and bFGF enhanced the proliferation of fibroblasts 5.7-fold and
   fivefold, respectively, while the addition of silicone particles had no
   significant effect on proliferation. Collagen production was increased
   approximately twofold with the addition of bFGF and the medium
   concentration of particles over bFGF without particles and the PDGF
   groups. The addition of silicone particles had no significant effect on
   collagen production compared with control groups without particles.
   Fibroblast migration was enhanced by the addition of both PDGF and bFGF
   compared to controls, although slower scratch wound closure rates were
   observed in the presence of particles compared to controls without
   particles. Cell morphology suggested that particles induced cellular
   aggregation encircling silicone particles postwounding as well as
   migration into the wound area. These results suggest that silicone
   particles in combination with a growth factor might enhance fibroblast
   aggregation and implant stability, and could promote connective tissue
   ingrowth and implant encapsulation in the soft tissue of the diabetic
   foot. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed Mater Res Part B: Appl

AB Injections of silicone fluid have been clinically evaluated to treat and
   prevent foot ulcers due to diminished plantar fat-pad in neuropathic
   diabetics. The objective of this study was to determine preliminary in
   vitro effects of an injectable form of silicone resin particles in
   combination with growth factors to determine the suitability of this
   potential therapy for prevention of diabetic foot ulcers. Basic
   fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF) and
   platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-BB) were added to monolayer culture
   along with silicone resin particles (12 mu m average diameter). Growth
   factors were also combined as follows: bFGF+PDGF-BB, EGF+PDGF-BB, and
   bFGF+EGF. Growth factors alone and in combination increased fibroblast
   proliferation, but the presence of particles did not significantly
   affect cellular proliferation. The addition of particles significantly
   increased fibronectin production 117% in the control group and 151% in
   the PDGF only group. Collagen production was increased with exposure to
   EGF and growth factor combinations, but the presence of particles did
   not lead to any significant differences, except an 81% increase in the
   bFGF group. These preliminary results suggest that a combination of PDGF
   and bFGF may be effective in stimulating proliferation and matrix
   production around injectable silicone resin particles to generate a
   fibrous tissue pad to alleviate the abnormal distribution of high
   pressures that contribute to diabetic foot ulcer formation. (C) 2009

AB Enzyme immunosorbent assays were used to measure cyclic nucleotide
   concentrations in homogenates of salivary glands from partially fed
   female Dermacentor variabilis. The adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin
   (100 mu M) increased homogenate cGMP concentrations greater than
   three-fold over controls. Competitive inhibition of nitric oxide
   synthase with 1 MM L-NMMA, an L-arginine analog, demonstrated that
   crosstalk occurs downstream of nitric oxide synthesis.
   Forskolin-stimulated synthesis of cGMP was diminished 58% by the soluble
   guanylyl cyclase inhibitor CDQ (2 mu M). The protein kinase A selective
   inhibitor Rp-cAMPS (50 mu M) inhibited forskolin-stimulated cGMP by 49%.
   Whole glands treated with 10 mu M dopamine increased cGMP levels
   two-fold in the presence of I mM IBMX. Treatment of whole salivary
   glands with equimolar concentrations of 8-Br-cAMP and 8-Br-cGMP produced
   no greater fluid uptake than in glands treated with 8-Br-cGMP alone,
   suggesting that cAMP and cGMP share a downstream target. The protein
   kinase G-selective inhibitor Rp-8-pCPT-cGMPS (100 mu M) impeded 10 mM
   8-Bromo-cGMP-stimulated gland weight increases. Pretreatment with
   verapamil, a Ca(2+) channel blocker, attenuated cyclic
   nucleotide-stimulated fluid uptake indicating that whole gland fluid
   changes are dependent on extracellular Ca(2+). Together, our data
   suggest that cGMP production is mediated in part by cAMP-dependent
   activation of soluble guanylyl cyclase. Experiments measuring changes in
   whole salivary gland weight support the hypothesis that cAMP and cGMP
   signaling cascades have a common target and that cyclic
   nucleotide-stimulated fluid movement is dependent on Ca(2+) influx. (C)

AB Lyophilization was evaluated in chitosan-calcium phosphate microspheres
   and scaffolds to improve drug delivery of growth factors and antibiotics
   for orthopedic applications. The dual delivery of an antibiotic and a
   growth factor from a composite scaffold would be beneficial for
   treatment of complex fracture sites, such as comminuted fractures and
   segmental bone defects. The aim of this investigation was to increase
   the loading capacity of the composite by taking advantage of the
   increased porosity, due to lyophilization, and to produce an extended
   elution profile using a secondary chitosan-bead coating. The
   physiochemical properties of the composite were investigated, and
   loading and elution studies were performed with alkaline phosphatase
   (ALP), bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2), and amikacin.
   Lyophilization was found to increase the surface area of scaffolds by
   over 400% and the porosity of scaffolds by 50%. Using ALP as a model
   protein, the loading capacity was increased by lyophilization from 4.3
   +/- 2.5 to 24.6 +/- 3.6 mu g ALP/mg microspheres, and the elution
   profile was extended by a supplemental chitosan coating. The loading
   capacity of BMP-2 for composite microspheres was increased from 74.4 +/-
   3.7 to 102.1 +/- 8.0 mu g BMP-2/g microspheres with lyophilization
   compared with nonlyophilized microspheres. The elution profiles of BMP-2
   and the antibiotic amikacin were not extended with the supplemental
   coating. Additional investigations are planned to improve these elution
   characteristics for growth factors and antibiotics. (C) 2009 Wiley

AB Dioxin is an extremely potent carcinogen. In highly exposed people, the
   most commonly observed toxicity is chloracne, a pathological response of
   the skin. Most of the effects of dioxin are attributed to its activation
   of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), a transcription factor that
   binds to the Ah receptor nuclear translocator ( ARNT) to regulate the
   transcription of numerous genes, including CYP1A1 and CYP1B1. In
   cultures of normal human epidermal keratinocytes dioxin accelerates cell
   differentiation, as measured by the formation of cornified envelopes. We
   show that this acceleration is mediated by the AHR; also, that dioxin
   increases the expression of several genes known to be regulated by ARNT,
   which have critical roles in the cornification and epidermal barrier
   function of the skin. Importantly, we demonstrate that all of these
   responses are opposed by ligand-activation of the EGF receptor ( R), an
   important regulator of keratinocyte cell fate. In the CYP1A1 enhancer,
   EGFR activation prevents recruitment of the p300 coactivator, although
   not affecting the binding of the AHR or ARNT. The total cellular level
   of p300 protein does not decrease, and overexpression of p300 relieves
   EGFR-mediated repression of transcription, indicating that p300 is a
   critical target for the repression of the AHR complex by EGFR signaling.
   These results provide a mechanism by which
   2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin is able to disrupt epidermal
   homeostasis and identify EGFR signaling as a regulator of the AHR. This
   signaling may modulate the incidence and severity of chloracne and be of
   therapeutic relevance to human poisonings by dioxin.

AB This study investigated the in vitro effect of low-intensity pulsed
   ultrasound (LIPUS) on human embryonic palatal mesenchyme cells (HEPM,
   CRL-1486, ATCC, Manassas, VA), an osteoblast precursor cell line, during
   early adhesion to calcium phosphate scaffolds. Hydroxyapatite (HA) and
   beta-tricalcium phosphate (TCP) ceramic scaffolds were produced by a
   template coating method. Phospho-specific antibody cell-based ELISA
   (PACE) technique was utilized on stress activation proteins, including
   the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2), P38, c-Jun
   N-terminal kinase (JNK) and the anti-apoptosis mediator protein kinase B
   (PKB/AKT). Cell-based ELISAs were also performed on the membrane
   anchoring protein vinculin and alpha 6 beta 4 integrin. LIPUS stimulated
   activation of PERK 1/2, PJNK, PP38 and vinculin in traditional
   two-dimensional (2-D) culture. Calcium release from the scaffolds was
   partially involved in the activation of PERK 1/2 when cell response was
   compared between culture on 2-D surfaces and three-dimensional (3-D) HA
   and TCP scaffolds. Effects of calcium extracted media from scaffolds
   alone could not account for the full activation of PJNK, PP38, PAKT,
   vinculin and alpha 6 beta 4 integrin. LIPUS stimulation further
   increased PERK activity on TCP scaffolds corresponding with an increase
   in both vinculin and alpha 6 beta 4 integrin levels. It was concluded
   from this study that LIPUS treatment can significantly affect stress
   signaling mediators and adhesion proteins in osteoblast precursor cells
   during the early cell-attachment phase to trabecular patterned
   scaffolds. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The objective of this research was to investigate stress-signaling
   patterns in response to two-dimensional (2-D) and three-dimensional
   (3-D) calcium phosphate (CP) materials using human embryonic palatal
   mesenchyme cells (HEPM CRL-1486, ATCC, Manassas, VA), an osteoblast
   precursor cell line. Control discs and scaffolds were fabricated front
   hydroxyapatite and beta tri-CP ceramics. Phospho-specific antibody
   cell-based ELISA technique was utilized on members of the
   mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade including; the extracellular
   signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2), p38, cJun N-terminal kinase (JNK),
   and the anti-apoptosis mediator protein kinase B (AKT). Quantification
   of these signals was evaluated during the early attachment phase of
   osteoblast precursor cells. In this study, it was observed that 3-D CP
   scaffolds significantly activated the stress mediators p38 and JNK but
   not ERK 1/2. This signal trend was matched with an up-regulation in AKT,
   suggesting the ability of cells to manage high stress signals in
   response to 3-D CP architecture and that 3-D CP scaffolds are necessary
   for studies simulating a natural trabecular bone organization. The
   absence of these signals in 2-D CP surfaces indicated the importance of
   local architecture conditions on cell stress response. It was concluded
   from this study that osteoblast precursor cells cultured in 3-D CP
   scaffolds experience greater stress-signaling patterns when compared to
   2-D CP surfaces. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The opossum kidney (OK) line displays PTH-mediated activation of
   adenylyl cyclase and phospholipase C and inhibition of phosphate (P-i)
   uptake via regulation of the type IIa sodium-phosphate cotransporter,
   consistent with effects in vivo. OKH cells, a subclone of the OK cell
   line, robustly activates PTH-mediated activation of adenylyl cyclase,
   but is defective in PTH-mediated inhibition of sodium-phosphate
   cotransport and signaling via phospholipase C. Compared with wild-type
   OK cells, OKH cells express low levels of the Na+/ H+ exchanger
   regulatory factor 1 (NHERF-1). Stable expression of NHERF-1 in OKH cells
   (OKH-N1) rescues the PTH-mediated inhibition of sodium-phosphate
   cotransport. NHERF-1 also restores the capacity of 8-bromo-cAMP and
   forskolin to inhibit P-i uptake, but the PTH dose-response for cAMP
   accumulation and inhibition of P-i uptake differ by 2 orders of
   magnitude. NHERF-1, in addition, modestly restores phorbol
   ester-mediated inhibition of P-i uptake, which is much weaker than that
   elicited by PTH. A poor correlation exists between the inhibition of P-i
   uptake mediated by PTH (similar to60%) and the inhibition mediated by
   phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (similar to30%) and the ability of these
   molecules to activate the protein kinase C-responsive reporter gene.
   Furthermore, we show that NHERF-1 directly interacts with type IIa
   cotransporter in OK cells. Although, PTH-mediated inhibition of P-i
   uptake in OK cells is largely NHERF-1 dependent, the signaling
   pathway(s) by which this occurs is still unclear. These pathways may
   involve cooperativity between cAMP- and protein kinase C-dependent
   pathways or activation/inhibition of an unrecognized NHERF-1-dependent
   pathway(s).

AB Many G protein-coupled receptor agonists activate p42/p44
   mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), using signaling pathways that
   are a function of receptor, G protein-coupled, and effector complement.
   In opossum kidney (OK) cells, activation of endogenous PTH receptors
   caused a time- (peak within 15-30 min, sustained for similar to 2 h) and
   dose-dependent (EC50 similar to 3 X 10(-10) M) activation of MAPK.
   Immunoblot analysis with an activation- specific MAPK antibody indicated
   that PTH activated both p42 and p44 MAPK. Epidermal growth factor (EGF)
   also activated p42 and p44MAPK in a time- (peak at 5 min, return to
   basal within 2 h) and dose-dependent (EC50 similar to 3 ng/ml) fashion.
   PTH-dependent MAPK activation was mimicked by the protein kinase C
   activator (PKC) phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), and the protein kinase
   A activators 8 bromo-cAMP (8-Br-cAMP) and forskolin but was not affected
   by pertussis toxin pretreatment. PMA or 8-Br-cAMP pretreatment blocked
   MAPK activation by reexposure to each kinase activator but caused no
   significant reduction in MAPK activation by PTH. MAPK activation by PTH,
   EGF, and 8-Br-cAMP was inhibited by the MAPK kinase inhibitor PD98059
   and an EGF receptor (EGFR)-selective inhibitor tyrphostin AG1478. AG1478
   also blocked MAPK activation by insulin-like growth factor-1 and
   platelet-derived growth factor. EGF and PTH caused time- and
   AG1478-sensitive phosphorylation of the EGFR, but EGFR desensitization
   did not affect MAPK activation by PTH. EGF, PMA, and low doses of PTH
   (10(12) to 10(-9) M) stimulated while 8-Br-cAMP and high doses of PTH
   (10(-8) to 10(-6) M) inhibited [H-3]thymidine uptake. These data
   demonstrate that PTH activates MAPK and suggest that PKC, protein kinase
   A, and the EGFR play roles in PTH signaling. The biphasic effect of PTH
   on DNA synthesis suggests that MAPK activation by the hormone leads to
   distinct cellular responses.

AB In many tissues, hyperglycemia alters the activities of the
   Na+-dependent myo-inositol (Na/MI) transporter, Na+-K+-ATPase, and
   protein kinase C (PKC). However, little is known concerning adaptive
   changes in renal proximal tubular function after acute or chronic
   hyperglycemia. We examined hyperglycemia-induced changes in Na/MI
   transport, Na+-K+-ATPase activity, and PKC activity using three proximal
   tubule-like cell lines (JTC12, LLC-PK1 and OK/E cells) and primary
   cultures of human proximal tubular epithelium (HK cells) cultured for
   varying periods in low- or high-glucose media. myo-Inositol (MI)
   transport was mediated by a high-affinity (K-m similar to 50 mu mol/l)
   Na+-dependent saturable process in the four cell lines, Hyperglycemia
   produced a time-dependent and persistent increase in Na/MI transport in
   all cell lines. Chronic hyperglycemia increased the K-m for MI transport
   in LLC-PK1 cells and increased the V-max in both LLC-PK1 and JTC12
   cells. Glucose competitively inhibited Na/MI transport in all
   low-glucose cells and in high-glucose RK, JTC12, and OK/E cells but had
   no effect on transport in high-glucose LLC-PK1 cells. Acute
   hyperglycemia also produced time-dependent increases in Na+-K+-ATPase
   activity in all cell lines, a change that persisted only in HK cells. A
   24-h exposure to high glucose had no effect on PKC activity in any of
   the cell lines but increased Ca/phospholipid-dependent PKC activity in
   membrane fractions from chronically high-glucose LLC-PK1 and OK/E cells.
   These data suggest that hyperglycemia causes acute changes in proximal
   tubule function and long-lived adaptive responses in Na/MI transport and
   the PKC signaling pathway.

AB We examined the effects of prolonged exposure to parathyroid hormone
   (PTH) and the protein kinase C (PKC) activator mezerein (MEZ) on cyclic
   adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production, PKC activity, and
   Na+dependent phosphate (Na/Pi) transport in an opossum kidney cell line
   (OK/E). A 5 minute exposure to PTH stimulated, while a 6 h incubation
   reduced, cAMP production. Na/Pi transport was maximally inhibited under
   desensitizing conditions and was not affected by reintroduction of the
   hormone. MEZ pretreatment (6 h) enhanced PTH-, cholera toxin (CTX)-, and
   forskolin (FSK)-stimulated cAMP production, suggesting enhanced Gs-alpha
   coupling and increased adenylyl cyclase activity. However, PKA- and
   PKC-dependent regulation of Na/Pi were blocked in MEZ-treated cells. The
   PTH-induced decrease in cAMP production was associated with a reduction
   in membrane-associated PKC activity while MEZ-induced increases in cAMP
   production were accompanied by decreases in membrane and cytosolic PKC
   activity. Enhanced cAMP production was not accompanied by significant
   changes in PTH/PTH related peptide (PTHrP) receptor affinity or number,
   nor was the loss of Na/Pi transport regulation associated with changes
   in PKA activity. The results indicate that down-regulation of PKC by PTH
   or MEZ differentially modulates cAMP production and regulation of Na/Pi
   transport. The distinct effects of PTH and MEZ on PKC activity suggest
   that agonist-specific activation and/or down-regulation of PKC
   isozyme(s) may be involved in the observed changes in cAMP production
   and Na/Pi transport.
