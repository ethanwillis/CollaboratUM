AB Reproduction is energetically demanding, and how much an individual is
   able to invest in reproduction is often a function of its health state.
   An understanding of the relationship between oxidative balance and
   reproductive decisions, especially in free-living species, is still very
   limited. We evaluated the relationship between oxidative health and
   reproductive effort in a free-living population of the cooperatively
   breeding Florida scrub jay Aphelocoma coerulescens. Specifically, we
   assessed whether prebreeding oxidative damage levels predicted
   reproductive effort and subsequently whether postbreeding oxidative
   damage levels reflected reproductive effort. Prebreeding oxidative
   damage levels were negatively correlated with reproductive effort in
   males. In males, postbreeding levels of oxidative damage were
   significantly greater than prebreeding levels. Given that females
   exhibited no such patterns, our results suggest that in this species,
   males bear the brunt of the oxidative costs associated with
   reproduction.

AB Context. Anthropogenic disturbances induce physiological and behavioural
   responses in numerous species. The negative effects of human disturbance
   are of special concern to threatened and endangered species.
   Aims. The present study aims to compare physiological stress measures
   and reproductive success of Florida scrub-jays (Aphelocoma coerulescens)
   living near roads with jays that live away from roads. Specifically, it
   aims to test whether roads are stressful.
   Methods. We assessed physiological measures that can serve as indicators
   of 'stress' to determine whether a highway that bisects our study site
   had physiological effects on adult male Florida scrub-jays. We captured
   male breeders from three territory types, including scrub habitat that
   (1) bordered a highway with a grassy shoulder that created an 'edge'
   habitat (roadside), (2) bordered human-maintained habitat (a plowed
   firebreak of sand with adjacent pasture) that served as a control for
   the edge-effect of the road (pasture) and (3) contained only natural
   scrub habitat (interior). We measured baseline concentrations of the
   stress hormone corticosterone (CORT), body mass, and a suite of
   longitudinal body measures to generate a body condition index in males
   from each territory type over three breeding seasons.
   Key results. Roadside jays had greater body mass than did interior and
   pasture jays, although there were no differences in overall baseline
   CORT concentrations or body condition among territory classes. There was
   no difference in clutch initiation date or size and nestling and
   independent-young survival.
   Conclusions. Our results suggest that the road through our study site
   has physiological effects on Florida scrub-jays; however, there is mixed
   evidence as to whether it acts as a chronic stressor.
   Implications. Our findings provide evidence that roads and
   road-associated disturbance has neutral or potentially beneficial
   physiological effects of roads on Florida scrub-jays. Knowledge of these
   effects of roads and disturbance on jays will hopefully provide
   additional opportunities to improve conservation of this species.

AB In physiological studies of free-living species, it is essential to
   consider the context of the life history stage at which an individual
   was observed in order to link measures of physiology with ecological
   parameters. One such measure that is important to consider is the age of
   an individual. We tested whether baseline or stress-induced
   corticosterone levels vary with age in free-living Florida scrub-jays
   (Aphelocoma coerulescens) during the pre-breeding period. Corticosterone
   (CORT), the primary avian stress hormone, is released in response to
   stressful stimuli, and stimulates gluconeogenesis; however, it also
   serves as a chemical messenger that can influence other physiological
   processes, reproduction, and behavior. We monitored both baseline CORT
   levels longitudinally throughout a five-year period and stress-induced
   CORT responses over a shorter two-year period. We predicted that older
   jays would have lower baseline CORT levels and a dampened stress
   response compared to younger birds, as has been shown in other avian
   species. We found no significant differences in baseline CORT levels
   with age. We found a decrease in total corticosterone responses to a
   stressor with age, however, the oldest birds in the population showed
   greater total corticosterone responses to a stressor. These results may
   be a product of age-related changes in physiological processes related
   to the stress response or a result of selection acting on the
   population, resulting in only the most responsive individuals surviving
   to old age. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB It is well known that variation in developmental conditions can have
   profound effects upon lifetime fitness. In altricial avian species,
   nestlings undergo a substantial portion of development in the nest after
   hatching, often in the presence of nest-mates. This can result in the
   formation of brood hierarchies based on age, size, and competitive
   ability. Measurement of baseline corticosterone (CORT) levels in
   developing birds may provide a means to assess whether individuals
   within a brood experience stress due to sibling competition or
   nutritional state. However, few studies have attempted to correlate
   corticosterone concentrations with brood hierarchies in free-living,
   developing birds. We investigated the degree to which corticosterone
   levels in nestling Florida scrub-jays (Aphelocoma coerulescens) were
   predicted by brood size, hatching order, and body mass. Nestling
   corticosterone levels were inversely correlated with body mass but did
   nor differ among brood sizes. Within broods of two, second-hatched
   nestlings had lower CORT than first-hatched nestlings, although there
   was no effect of hatch order in broods of three or four nestlings. The
   results of this study suggest that conditions within the nest,
   particularly those associated with within-brood hierarchies, are
   manifested through differential body condition and nestling
   corticosterone secretion. The consequences of this variation in nestling
   corticosterone are unknown, but development of the adult phenotype, as
   well as life-long survival, may be impacted. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All

AB Recent studies have posited that the pattern of glucocorticoid secretion
   within an individual represents a stable, fixed physiological trait To
   test this hypothesis, we assessed the repeatability of baseline and
   stress-induced corticosterone (CORT) secretion across developmental
   stages and years in Florida scrub-jays. We sampled individuals from
   multiple cohorts repeatedly from the age of 11 days post-hatch up to 4
   years of age. We found a significant degree of repeatability within
   individuals in stress-induced corticosterone levels, i.e., the amount of
   hormone secreted during a standardized stress protocol (corrected
   integrated corticosterone). However, baseline corticosterone levels were
   not statistically repeatable, although there was some indication that
   nestling levels predicted levels at 1 year of age. The results of this
   study indicate that stress-induced CURT levels are consistent within
   individual scrub-jays, and the degree to which a young jay mounts an
   acute stress response appears to be somewhat "set" by the age of
   nutritional independence. Thus stress-induced corticosterone secretion
   appears to be a stable, repeatable trait within individuals and as such
   may be subject to natural selection. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights

AB Antioxidants play key roles in preventing free radical damage to various
   molecules, cells, and tissues, but it is not well understood how
   variation in antioxidant levels may relate to the reproductive success
   or health of wild animals. We explored the relationship between
   circulating antioxidant concentrations and both body condition and
   timing of reproduction in male and female Florida Scrub-Jays (Aphelocoma
   coerulescens), a cooperatively breeding passerine bird. We examined
   whether levels of uric acid, vitamin E, and carotenoids (all potentially
   important antioxidants) were linked to body condition and timing of
   reproduction, two measures that are directly related to reproductive
   success. Antioxidant concentrations were not correlated with body
   condition, but they were related to timing of first clutch initiation,
   though not always in the predicted direction. Elevated circulating
   levels of carotenoids were associated with delayed clutch initiation in
   female breeders. Relatively higher vitamin E levels in control birds
   were associated with earlier clutch initiation, whereas male breeders
   that received long-term food supplementation had elevated levels of
   vitamin E and delayed reproduction. Several potential explanations for
   the link between elevated levels of antioxidants and delayed clutch
   initiation are discussed. Separate explanations for each sex include,
   but are not limited to, oxidative stress as a result of territory
   defense efforts in males, different dietary regimes due to
   supplementation, and mobilized plasma antioxidants in females that were
   coping with a stressor. J. Exp. Zool. 315: 101-110, 2011. (C) 2010

AB A growing body of evidence from across taxa suggests that exposure to
   elevated levels of glucocorticoids during early development can have
   long-term effects upon physiological and behavioral phenotypes.
   Additionally, there is some, though limited, evidence that similar early
   exposure can also negatively impact cognitive ability. Following
   pioneering mammalian studies, several avian studies have revealed that
   the responsiveness of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis as an
   adult can be explained by levels of corticosterone, the avian
   glucocorticoid, the individual experienced as a nestling or even as an
   embryo via yolk exposure. Studies also suggest that perinatal exposure
   to corticosterone can have effects upon avian 'personalities' or coping
   styles, and findings from mammalian studies suggest that these long-term
   effects are mediated epigenetically via altered expression of relevant
   DNA sequences. Although a consistent pattern across-species has yet to
   emerge, recent work in Florida scrub-jays Aphelocoma coerulescens found
   that baseline corticosterone levels in 11-day-old nestlings explained
   84% of the variation in 'personality' (bold vs. timid) when those
   individuals were tested approximately seven months later. Nestlings with
   elevated corticosterone levels were more timid than those individuals
   that as nestlings experienced relatively low corticosterone levels. Some
   researchers have suggested that parents might use such mechanisms to
   'program' their offsprings' phenotype to best fit prevailing
   environmental conditions. This review will visit what is known about the
   links between stressful developmental conditions that result in exposure
   to elevated corticosterone and the short-and long-term effects of this
   steroid hormone upon central nervous system function and whether
   alterations thereof are beneficial, deleterious, or neutral. It will
   concentrate on examples from birds, although critical supporting studies
   from the mammalian literature will be included as appropriate [ Current
   Zoology 57 (4): 514-530, 2011].

AB Hatching failure within clutches of eggs occurs to varying degrees in
   many avian species. We investigated predictors of hatching failure in a
   population of Florida Scrub-Jays, for which hatching success has been
   monitored for 15 years. We assessed whether hatching failure was related
   to parental traits (e. g. age, experience as a pair or body condition),
   lay date, social structure (e. g. number of helpers), environmental
   conditions, or some combination of these. We used linear mixed models
   and Akaike's information criterion to determine the models that best
   explain observed patterns of hatching failure. The best model showed
   that increased hatching failure was associated with below-average
   rainfall during the breeding season, and was more common for newly
   established breeding pairs than for pairs that had previously produced
   one or more clutches together. Other contributing models suggested that
   hatching failure was greatest for the youngest and oldest female
   breeders. Some aspects of our findings are consistent with conclusions
   drawn from other species. However, as a whole, our analyses suggest that
   hatching failure in the Florida Scrub-Jay is influenced by a complex set
   of environmental and parental factors.

AB In species that undergo actuarial senescence, the value of current
   reproduction is predicted to increase relative to the value of future
   reproduction with age, as the probability of survival to another
   reproductive event is reduced. Therefore, life history theory predicts
   that aging animals should increase their investment in reproduction.
   However, an increase in reproductive investment may carry significant
   costs to the breeding individuals. We recorded provisioning rates of
   Florida scrub-jay male breeders, followed by their immediate capture to
   assess body condition and collect blood for an in vitro test of
   immunocompetence and an assay of baseline corticosterone for a measure
   of stress. Older males provisioned offspring and brooding mates at the
   highest rates. There was no evidence of any physiological deficits in
   males with high provisioning rates, independent of age. It appears that
   birds that survive to old age are high quality birds that maintain good
   physiological condition, which complements the value of experience and
   permits maximal investment in offspring.

AB Roads may have detrimental effects on many bird species, but areas
   adjacent to roads also provide habitat and food for some species. To
   address the influence of roadside habitat on the federally threatened
   Florida Scrub-Jay (Aphelocoma coerulescens), we compared foraging
   effort, the amount of food collected, and estimated energy intake in
   three habitat types: (1) edges along a paved road (roadside), (2) edges
   created by human-maintained habitat without a road (pasture), and (3)
   natural scrub-dominated areas with minimal human-maintained edges
   (interior). We used focal watches of male breeders during three stages
   of the breeding season (incubation, nestling, and fledged young) in two
   consecutive years to assess variation in food availability and energetic
   intake among the three habitat types. Florida Scrub-Jays in roadside
   habitats handled (consumed, cached, or fed to their mate or offspring)
   significantly more food items and spent less time foraging during the
   nestling stage than interior and pasture jays, but no differences in
   handled food were found among the three habitat types during the
   incubation and fledgling stages. Although they spent less time foraging,
   roadside jays had higher rates of energy intake than interior and
   pasture jays during the incubation stage. There were no differences in
   these measures of foraging during the incubation, nestling, and
   fledgling stages between interior and pasture jays. Our results suggest
   that roads or roadside habitat, not simply edge habitats, have a
   positive effect on food availability and energy intake in Florida
   Scrub-Jays, although the patterns differ across breeding stages.

AB Stressful conditions during development may have lasting consequences
   for an animal's lifetime fitness. We investigated the degree to which
   parental provisioning and nest attendance influenced baseline levels of
   the stress hormone corticosterone in nestling Florida scrub-jays.
   Provisioning rates of male and female breeders and nest attendance of
   female breeders were recorded during focal watches conducted between
   days 3 and 5 post-hatch. A small blood sample was taken from each
   nestling on day 11 post-hatch and used to quantify levels of baseline
   corticosterone. The proportion of time spent by female breeders at a
   considerable distance from the nest was positively related to nestling
   corticosterone levels. Nestling corticosterone was also negatively
   related to parental provisioning rate, although this effect seemed to be
   secondary to the effect of the female's time away from the nest. These
   results indicate that parental behavior contributes to nestling stress
   physiology, which may in turn direct the formation of the adult
   phenotype and influence an individual's chances of survival. (c) 2009

AB Nestlings of altricial species undergo a period of substantial growth
   and development in the nest after hatching. The
   hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis regulates the release of stress
   hormones such as corticosterone, which in adults is critical in allowing
   an animal to respond to a stressor. However, activation of this axis in
   young birds may be detrimental to growth and possibly survival. The
   developmental hypothesis predicts that altricial nestlings should
   display a dampened corticosterone response to stress as a means of
   protection against the potentially harmful effects of elevated
   corticosterone. We examined this hypothesis in Florida scrub-jays, a
   cooperatively breeding species with altricial young. Blood samples were
   collected from nestlings, nutritionally independent young, and yearlings
   for measurement of corticosterone levels. Baseline corticosterone levels
   did not differ between age-classes; however, stress-induced
   corticosterone levels were highest in yearlings, intermediate in
   independent young, and lowest in nestlings. The nestling stress response
   was also of a shorter duration than the response in independent young
   and yearlings. This variation in stress responsiveness across ages may
   be an adaptive mechanism to protect the developing bird from the
   negative effects of corticosterone on growth and cognitive development.

AB Food supplementation of free-living animals has been used to address the
   role of availability of resources in the timing of reproduction. A
   meta-analysis by Schoech and Hahn suggested that responsiveness of the
   reproductive axis to the supplementary cue of food is lessened at higher
   latitudes, presumably because the brief time during which conditions are
   appropriate to rear offspring has led to an evolved resistance to
   supplementary cues with a primary reliance on photoperiod.
   Unfortunately, few investigators have examined the potential underlying
   mechanisms that mediate this differential responsiveness to supplemental
   food across latitudes. Considerable research, however, links nutritional
   state and plasma glucocorticoid levels, both of which impinge upon the
   reproductive axis. Long-term research, on Florida scrub-jays (Aphelocoma
   coerulescens) in my laboratory shows that suburban birds with access to
   ad libitum supplemental food express early breeding and lower plasma
   corticosterone (CORT) levels in comparison to jays in nearby natural
   habitat. Furthermore, supplementation in natural habitat advances
   laying, with the largest effects occurring in bad years (i.e., years
   defined by late breeding and poor reproductive output by
   non-supplemented controls). Similarly, reproductive output of
   supplemented jays is greater and exhibits considerably less variance
   than do controls, suggesting fitness benefits of supplementation that
   are tied to advanced breeding. Generally, CORT levels in early-breeding
   supplemented jays are lower than are those of controls. Also, regression
   analysis suggests that clutch-initiation dates of non-supplemented
   female breeders are predicted by baseline CORT levels. Although these
   data are not conclusive and trends can be obscured by year-effects, they
   suggest a role for CORT in timing of breeding. Whether this link might
   help to explain the above-referenced latitudinal trends remains to be
   characterized.

AB Glucocorticoids mediate glucose availability under stressful and
   non-stressful conditions and, therefore, are essential for life.
   However, data across taxa demonstrate that chronic or elevated secretion
   of corticosterone or cortisol (CORT) can have negative effects at many
   levels and can trigger physiological or behavioral responses that may
   delay or, even halt reproduction. We present a brief overview of the
   effects that glucocorticoids, primarily the avian form, corticosterone,
   can have on the reproductive axis. Considerable data have demonstrated
   that environmental perturbations can result in elevated CORT levels that
   alter a bird's investment in current reproduction. Studies in our
   laboratory have shown a link between CORT and timing of reproduction in
   Florida scrub-jays: in "bad" years, clutch initiation dates are
   positively correlated with baseline CORT levels of female breeders.
   Also, population-level differences in CORT levels may explain timing of
   reproduction as lower CORT levels in suburban-dwelling jays are coupled
   with early breeding.
   Most research on stress and CORT concentrates on transient effects of
   CORT secretion. However, developmental CORT exposure, either from the
   yolk or embryo, may have long-term effects upon adult phenotype. For
   example, CORT levels in nestling scrub-jays predicts later
   'personality,' as levels were highly correlated (r(2) = 0.84) with
   fearfulness at 7 months of age. One can imagine that such 'personality'
   traits might also translate into differential success in gaining a
   territory or a mate. While speculative, it may be that early CORT
   exposure effectively programs adult behaviors that have wide ranging
   effects, including upon reproduction. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights

AB Florida Scrub-Jays (Aphelocoma coerulescens) in a suburban environment
   with year-round access to multiple sources of abundant, human-source
   foods consistently breed earlier each year and have lower baseline
   levels of circulating corticosterone (CORT) than jays in a nearby
   wildland setting. These findings suggest that food supplies influence
   CORT levels, which in turn may partially determine the timing of
   reproduction. However, wildland birds with access to high-quality
   supplemental foods did not advance breeding or lower CORT levels to the
   degree observed in the suburbs. Therefore, rather than quality or
   quantity of food consumed, the perception of a reliable and predictable
   food supply may be an important factor in determining laying dates. If a
   predictable food Supply accelerates the reproductive process, it follows
   that food provided on an unpredictable schedule may slow reproduction.
   We subjected captive Western Scrub-Jays (A. californica) to a 30day
   photoperiod transition from short- to long-days and tested whether birds
   with access to food on an unpredictable schedule exhibited delayed or
   reduced production of reproductive hormones compared with birds given
   food on a predictable schedule. Baseline CORT concentrations increased
   slightly during the experiment, but did not differ between treatment
   groups. Birds with unpredictable food had slightly lower testosterone
   levels relative to controls, but there was no effect on estradiol or
   luteinizing hormone. Our findings offer weak support for the hypothesis
   that an unpredictable food supply will delay the onset of reproduction;
   however, the artificial lab environment may limit the application of
   these findings to free-living populations. J. Exp. Zool. 311A:35 44,

AB Food supplementation experiments have provided considerable information
   about the importance of resource availability in timing reproduction.
   Supplemented birds usually advance breeding over non-supplemented
   controls. Initial observations suggested that degree of advancement in
   studies conducted at higher latitudes was less than in those at lower
   latitudes. We hypothesized that birds at high latitudes are less
   responsive to the "supplementary" cue of food. We tested this hypothesis
   using a literature-based meta-analysis of 36 papers which, because
   several papers presented separate data sets from different years,
   yielded 56 "studies." We used step-wise regression to determine whether
   latitude, elevation, the duration of supplementation, and the migratory
   status of the species predicted the degree to which mean clutch
   initiation dates of food supplemented birds differed from
   non-supplemented controls (i.e., effect size = (X) over bar (cnt) -(X)
   over bar (suppl) ). Consistent with our predictions, there was a
   significant inverse relationship between effect size and latitude:
   elevation, migratory status, and duration of treatment contributed
   little to the model. Because the response of animals' reproductive
   systems to environmental information is mediated by the neuroendocrine
   system, we discuss two models: (1) the adaptive specialization
   hypothesis in which higher latitude species that experience a relatively
   short breeding season have evolved a reliance on photic cues while
   exhibiting reduced sensitivity to non-photic cues; and (2) the
   conditional plasticity hypothesis in which an individual might show a
   marked response to non-photic information if it lived at low latitudes,
   but be largely driven by photic cues, endogenous rhythms, or both to the
   relative exclusion of non-photic information if it lived at higher
   latitudes.

AB The federally threatened Florida Scrub-Jay (Aphelocoma coerulescens) has
   suffered dramatic losses in recent years primarily because of
   overdevelopment of its unique scrub habitat. Ensuring the survival of
   this species will require not only measures to reduce habitat loss, but
   also efforts to increase the numbers of birds in small scattered
   populations to a point at which they are resilient to extinction from
   stochastic population fluctuations. Here we evaluate the utility of
   providing supplementary food during the pre-breeding season as a means
   of increasing the reproductive output of Florida Scrub-jays. Data
   collected from 2000 to 2007 at Archbold Biological Station in
   south-central Florida indicate a marked effect of supplemental feeding
   on reproductive output. This increased output appeared to result
   primarily from larger clutch sizes produced by supplemented female
   breeders as a result of their advanced laying. Supplementation also
   increased offspring survival probabilities and the early laying
   permitted more renesting attempts. Furthermore, annual variation in
   several reproductive measures was dampened in supplemented birds,
   suggesting that supplemental feeding may reduce environmental or
   stochastic effects on reproductive output. Although a number of
   potential problems may be associated with supplemental feeding (e.g.,
   predator entrainment and increased opportunity for disease
   transmission), it can serve as a valuable tool for management agencies
   that wish to rapidly increase local carrying capacity. In addition, food
   supplementation might benefit translocation efforts both by increasing
   the number of potential translocation candidates from a donor population
   and then by supplementing the newly established population to promote
   rapid growth. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The avian egg contains maternal hormones that affect behavior, growth,
   morphology, and offspring survival. Evidence to date suggests that
   patterns of yolk androgen deposition could provide females with a means
   to manipulate sibling competition and, thereby, increase their fitness.
   We examined yolk testosterone (T) concentrations in eggs of the
   smooth-billed ani (Crotophaga ani) to understand patterns of androgen
   deposition in eggs of this plural-breeding joint-nesting cooperatively
   breeding species. We tested the hatching; asynchrony adjustment
   hypothesis, which states that increases in yolk androgen levels over the
   laying sequence function to mitigate the disadvantage of being a
   later-hatched chick in species without adaptive brood reduction. We also
   investigated the effect of group size on yolk T deposition to test the
   hypothesis that females in multi-female groups could give a competitive
   edge to their own chicks by depositing higher T levels in their eggs.
   Predictions of the hatching asynchrony adjustment hypothesis were
   supported in both single- and multi-female groups as yolk testosterone
   levels increased from early- to late-laid eggs. This suggests that ani
   females can influence nestling competition and chick survival by
   within-clutch differential T allocation. Unexpectedly, we did not
   observe an effect of group size on yolk T deposition. Yolk testosterone
   concentrations may not be a mere reflection of a female's hormonal
   status as female plasma circulating levels of T did not vary in the same
   direction as yolk T levels. Results of this study therefore support the
   idea that females may adaptively manipulate chick behavior through
   hormonal deposition in eggs. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Recent studies of avian vision and plumage coloration have revealed a
   surprising degree of cryptic sexual dimorphism, with many examples of
   male-female differences in UV reflectance that are invisible to humans.
   We examined the potential for male-female and adult-subadult differences
   in plumage coloration in the genus Aphelocoma. This group of jays
   comprises 10 phylogenetic species, which are found across southern and
   central North America and include cooperatively breeding species, as
   well as species that form socially monogamous pair-bonds typical of most
   species of birds. Our goal was to determine whether male-female and
   adult-subadult differences in plumage coloration were more common in
   species with complex social systems (i.e., cooperative breeders). We
   collected a series of reflectance measurements from hundreds of museum
   specimens and analyzed the results using a model of an avian visual
   system. We found that age- and sex-related differences were not more
   frequent in species that practice cooperative breeding. Hence, plumage
   signaling relating sex and age may not be strongly associated with
   complex social systems. Rather, the relative lack of a stable and
   familiar social environment, as well as other selective pressures and
   constraints (e.g., habitat use and plumage complexity), may have favored
   a greater degree of age- and sex-related differences in plumage
   coloration in jays that practice simple biparental care.

AB Egg volumes are most often estimated using a mathematical model that
   incorporates length and width measurements and a species-specific shape
   variable. Although adequate in many respects, this technique does not
   account for intraspecific variation in egg shape. We developed a
   computer-automated technique that uses calibrated digital photographs to
   render precise measurements of several egg-size parameters including
   length, width, volume, and surface area. The system extracts egg
   outlines from photographs, and divides each egg into latitudinal slices
   that are subsequently regarded as simple geometric shapes (cylinders or
   cone frustra) with volumes and surface areas that can be summed to
   generate size parameters for the entire egg. We tested this technique
   using 491 eggs from Florida Scrub-Jay (Aphelocoma coerulescens) nests
   and compared the resulting egg volumes with volumes calculated using the
   preeminent method of estimating volume from linear measurements. Our
   method was highly accurate, and differences between the volumes from our
   method and the alternative method were strongly associated with
   variation in egg shape. Advantages of our technique include decreased
   handling of eggs and increased accuracy. Software resources and

AB Food supplementation usually advances the timing of laying. Here, we
   report a meta-analysis of 35 food supplementation studies demonstrating
   that species at high latitudes are less responsive to food
   supplementation than those at lower latitudes. Because the length of the
   breeding season varies with latitude, species at high latitudes may rely
   mostly upon photic cues and be less responsive to other environmental
   information. Lower latitude species, where times suitable for breeding
   vary from year-to-year, are predicted to be more responsive to
   "supplementary'' information to adjust reproduction to coincide with
   conditions that favor the successful rearing of young. Studies by
   Wingfield et al. (Gen Comp Endocrinol 101: 242-255, 1996; Gen Comp
   Endocrinol 107: 44 62, 1997; Gen Comp Endocrinol 131: 143-158, 2003)
   suggest a physiological underpinning to this reduced responsiveness to
   supplementary information in high-latitude species. Given that
   temperature increases resulting from global climate change are most
   pronounced at high latitude, reduced plasticity to respond to these
   changes in individuals of high-latitude species could cause
   high-latitude breeders to be poorly synchronized with a resource base
   that emerges earlier than usual. If high-latitude breeders indeed lack
   sufficient individual-level plasticity to cope effectively with climate
   fluctuations, effective optimization of reproductive timing in a rapidly
   changing environment would require similarly rapid evolutionary change.
   It remains to be seen whether this will be possible.

   living in suburban habitats, as well as birds that reside in a natural
   habitat (hereafter referred to as wildland birds) provided Supplemental
   food during the pre-breeding period, have lower baseline corticosterone
   (CORT) levels than nonsupplemented wildland birds, suggesting that
   predictable and abundant foods can lower stress levels. Here, we
   investigate whether the acute CORT response to capture stress reflects
   our earlier findings. During the pre-breeding seasons in 2004 and 2005
   we captured over 200 Florida Scrub-Jays and collected four blood samples
   from each bird over a 30 min time period. We compared hormonal and
   morphometric data from birds in four treatment groups: wildland birds
   that were provided with supplemental food during the pre-breeding
   period, wildland birds that were provided with supplemental food during
   the winter and pre-breeding period, nonsupplemented wildland birds, and
   suburban birds that effectively have access to ad libitum human-source
   food year-round. Suburban birds had lower baseline levels, and a more
   acute initial CORT response (i.e., rate of increase) than wildland
   birds, but we did not observe any differences among the treatment groups
   of wildland birds. Baseline CORT concentrations were unusually low
   across treatments in 2005, a year that was characterized by increased
   adult body mass, superior body condition, and a high fledgling success
   rate. all of which suggest favorable environmental conditions. Thus,
   abundant or more reliable food sources in 2005 may have overwhelmed any
   potential benefits of supplemental feeding and explain the absence of
   any strong experimental effects on CORT for that year. (C) 2007 Elsevier

AB We investigated a postulated trade-off between reproduction and immune
   function by comparing the energetic costs of an immune response with
   phytohemagglutinin challenge (or injection) in castrated (low
   testosterone [T]) and intact (high T) Japanese Quail (Coturnix
   coturnix). Intact birds had higher resting metabolic rate (RMR) and
   significantly lower immune response than castrates. RMR of intact birds
   did not change in response to an immune challenge, suggesting that
   maintenance of reproductive tissues and associated high T is both
   immunosuppressive and energetically costly. Despite having a greater
   immune response than intact quail, castrates had a lower pre-challenge
   RMR than intact birds and paradoxically tended to decrease RMR during an
   immune challenge. This paradox may be because of pro-inflammatory
   cytokines that are released during immune responses. Cytokines promote
   energy conservation through malaise and soporific behaviors, possibly
   explaining the co-occurrence of a relatively strong immune response and
   a decrease in nocturnal RMR in castrates. The lower immune response in
   intact birds may not elicit as great a response of pro-inflammatory
   cytokines owing to an already elevated RMR from reproductive state, thus
   reducing any effect on RMR. The suppressed immune response and elevated
   RMR in intact birds may be because of T; however, we cannot separate the
   effects of T per se from the metabolic requirements of reproductive
   tissues.

AB Providing supplemental food to Florida scrub-jays (Aphelocoma
   coerulescens) causes a reliable advance in clutch initiation of 1 to 2
   weeks. In some years, supplemental food appeared to not only advance
   laying date but also decrease baseline concentrations of corticosterone
   (CORT) relative to controls. The coincidence of low CORT levels and
   early breeding led us to hypothesize that CORT serves to communicate
   information about environmental conditions to the
   hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis, which ultimately influences
   the timing of breeding. To test this hypothesis, we administered small
   oral doses of CORT three times each day to female breeders that were
   provisioned with supplemental food. We compared clutch initiation dates
   of the CORT-dosed females to females with supplementation but no
   exogenous CORT and to females with neither CORT nor supplemental food.
   CORT administration had a strong temporary effect on circulating CORT
   concentrations but clutch initiation did not differ between the two
   groups of supplemented birds, both of which laid eggs approximately 10
   days earlier than nonsupplemented birds. Furthermore, during the year of
   our study we found no reduction in baseline CORT concentrations in our
   undosed supplemental groups, as had been observed in past studies. (c)

AB Optimal foraging theory assumes that a forager can adequately assess the
   quality of its prey and predicts that parents feed their young
   low-quality foods only when suffering unpredicted reductions in their
   ability to provision. Wildland Florida scrub-jays feed their young
   exclusively arthropods, but suburban parents include human-provided
   foods in the nestling diet, with possible costs in terms of reduced
   growth and survival. We tested experimentally whether parents feed
   human-provided foods, given the apparent costs, because: 1) they do not
   discriminate between food types, 2) they switch to low-quality, abundant
   foods when natural food availability in the environment is low, or 3)
   they switch when the time needed to obtain natural food is high. Parents
   discriminated between natural and human-provided foods by showing a
   preference for natural foods when rearing young. When the handling time
   of natural foods was increased experimentally, parents in the suburban
   and wildland habitats switched to human-provided foods. Supplementation
   with natural foods increased preference for this food in both habitats.
   Suburban parents chose more natural foods than wildland parents,
   suggesting that they have a greater preference for natural foods.
   Regardless of preferences demonstrated at feeders, parents in both the
   suburbs and wildlands delivered mostly natural foods to nestlings,
   independent of natural food availability. Nonetheless, natural foods are
   likely to be scarcer in the environment than in our experimental tests.
   Because natural food availability is lower in the suburbs than in the
   wildland habitat, parents in the suburbs may be forced to switch to
   human-provided foods when feeding nestlings.

AB Annual spring relapse of blood parasite infections in birds is believed
   to be the result of hormonal changes associated with breeding. As part
   of it larger study on the epizootiology of Haemoproteus danilewskyi in
   blue jays in south-central Florida. we studied the relationship between
   H. danilewskyi infections and levels of luteinizing hormone, prolactin,
   progesterone, testosterone, estradiol, and corticosterone. We found a
   positive association between intensity of H. lewskyi infection and
   corticosterone levels in females but not in males. We also found no
   association between infection and levels of prolactin. luteinizing
   hormone, progesterone, testosterone, or estradiol in males or females.
   In addition, we found a positive relationship between levels of
   corticosterone and handling time and between corticosterone and
   testosterone levels. We suggest a possible influence of corticosterone
   oil spring relapse of Haemoproteus spp. infections in birds but provide
   no support for the influence of breeding hormones on relapse of these
   parasites.

AB Food supplementation studies demonstrate the importance of resources in
   the timing of reproduction. Studies of Florida Scrub-Jays (Aphelocoma
   coerulescens) found that supplemented jays bred earlier than
   unsupplemented jays and that protein may play a critical role. In this
   study, free-living scrub-jays were provided with supplemental diets high
   in fat and protein (HFHP) or high in fat and low in protein (HFLP). Jays
   in both treatments bred earlier than unsupplemented controls (CNT), but
   HFHP-supplemented jays bred earlier than HFLP jays. To assess possible
   mechanisms, we measured testosterone (T) in males, estradiol (E-2) in
   females, and corticosterone (CORT) in both. HFHP males had higher T than
   HFLP and CNT males, but treatment did not affect E-2 levels of females.
   Pilot studies of scrub-jays in suburban environments suggest that the
   spatial and temporal predictability of food may influence corticosterone
   (CORT) levels. Suburban jays have year-round access to human-provided
   foods and breed earlier than wildland jays; thus, we compared CORT in
   all treatments in the natural site (wildlands) with those of suburban
   jays. CORT levels of suburban jays were lower than HFLP, HFHP, and CNT
   jays. HFHP-supplemented jays had lower CORT levels than those of HFLP
   and CNT jays. The observed differences in the timing of breeding, both
   between suburban and wildland populations and between experimental
   groups in the wildlands, may result from differences in the spatial and
   temporal predictability of food, and the nutritional differences in
   diets. Because CORT can negatively affect the reproductive axis, we
   postulate that nutrient availability, the predictability of food, CORT
   levels, and initiation of reproduction are inextricably linked. (C) 2004

AB Food availability is one of the most important determinants of
   successful reproduction in birds. In a previous study, it was shown that
   Florida scrub-jays Aphelocoma coerulescens maintained a third egg mass
   when supplemented with a high fat and high protein diet during
   pre-breeding, as opposed to birds that were not supplemented that laid
   third eggs markedly lighter in mass than first- and second-laid eggs.
   Increases in egg quality promote chick growth and survival in many avian
   species. In this study, scrub-jays were provided with supplements
   throughout the pre-laying and nestling periods of 2001 and 2002 to
   investigate whether diet quality influenced growth and survival of
   chicks. Fledging success and survival to independence of unsupplemented
   chicks were higher for 2002 compared with 2001 indicating that breeding
   conditions (e.g. natural food availability) for jays were probably
   improved in the former year. Consistent growth patterns were found
   during the first I I days post-hatch between chicks on supplemented and
   those on unsupplemented territories. Of the three growth measures, only
   seventh primary feather growth tended to be greater for third-hatched
   chicks on supplemented territories compared with third-hatched chicks on
   control territories. Food supplementation influenced survival of chicks.
   Compared with chicks hatching on unsupplemented territories, fledging
   success of chicks hatching from second-laid eggs was significantly
   greater in 2001, but not in 2002. Chicks from third-laid eggs on
   supplemented territories also tended to survive better in 2001 compared
   with chicks from unsupplemented territories, but, again, no such effect
   was found in 2002. We conclude that food supplementation in the
   pre-laying and nestling periods results in little measurable improvement
   in chick growth. However, improvements were found in survival of chicks
   that may be mediated through improvements in egg quality, but also may
   be the result of changes in foraging strategies of provisioning birds on
   supplemented territories. Chicks on supplemented territories might be in
   better body condition than those on unsupplemented ones. Methods other
   than morphometrics may be required to detect elevations in body
   condition of chicks raised on supplemented territories.

AB Timing of breeding in Florida Scrub-jays (Aphelocoma coerulescens)
   varies both within and between years. Social status and breeding
   experience may explain much of the within-year variation, but the
   availability of certain foods may partially explain between-year
   patterns. Scrub-jays in suburban habitats with access to unlimited
   human-provided foods breed earlier and with less between-year variation
   in timing of breeding than jays in wildland habitats. We hypothesized
   that those differences in timing of breeding result from access to
   human-provided foods in the suburban site. Human-provided food may
   influence timing of breeding by improving the overall body condition of
   females, or it may influence breeding by providing nutrients essential
   for breeding. If condition mediated, breeding females in the two
   habitats should differ in certain physiological parameters relative to
   time before egg laying and calendar date. If the effect is not related
   to body condition, we expect differences in pre-breeding females
   relative to calendar date, but not in relation to time before egg
   laying. To test those predictions, we measured plasma levels of total
   protein, calcium, luteinizing hormone, and estradiol. We also measured
   variables associated with body condition-body mass, a size-corrected
   condition index, and total body lipids. Most variables tended to
   increase with both days before laying and calendar date, except total
   body lipids, which decreased. Suburban females had higher levels of
   plasma protein relative to both days before egg laying and calendar date
   than female breeders in the wildland habitat. Luteinizing hormone
   differed between sites relative to calendar date but not days before
   laying. Our data suggest that suburban scrub-jays with access to
   predictable sources of high-quality human-provided foods accumulate
   endogenous protein that can be used to breed earlier. Received 25

AB The mountain white-crowned sparrow, Zonotrichia leucophrys oriantha,
   breeds in subalpine meadows throughout many mountainous regions of
   western North America. Mathematical analysis of 20 years of egg-laying
   dates at Tioga Pass, California (3030m elevation) indicated a highly
   predictable breeding season suggesting that precise environmental cues
   such as the annual change in day length were important for regulating
   reproductive function. Additionally, it appeared that there was
   sufficient yearly variation in the timing of breeding to suggest that
   other environmental cues may also be important for regulating
   adjustments in reproductive development and regression. Captive
   populations of Z. l. oriantha showed strong responses in gonadal
   development following transfer to longs days (15L 913) and low
   temperature (5degreesC) slowed down photoperiodically induced gonadal
   growth and subsequent regression, in both males and females. High
   temperature of 30degreesC tended to accelerate gonadal development and
   regression whereas gonadal development was intermediate in a group
   exposed to 20 degreesC. Prior exposure to these temperature regimes
   while on short days (9L 15D) had no effect on body mass, fat, or plasma
   levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and thyroid hormones. Curiously there
   was no effect of temperature on photoperiodically induced rises in LH in
   either sex despite marked effects on gonadal growth. Brood patch
   development was also enhanced in females exposed to 30degreesC.
   Corticosterone levels measured in a subset of plasma samples from this
   experiment indicated no effect of temperature suggesting that the
   retarded gonadal development at 5 degreesC was not a result of thermal
   stress. Although there was a robust effect of photo stimulation on
   thyroid hormone levels in blood of both sexes, temperature treatment had
   no effect on tri-iodothyronine (T3) concentrations. However, plasma
   levels of thyroxine (T4) were lower initially at 5 degreesC versus 20
   and 30 degreesC treatments. This may be related to the protracted
   gonadal cycle at 5 degreesC versus the truncated gonadal cycle at 30
   degreesC. Molt score, an indication of post-reproductive state and onset
   of photorefractoriness, was delayed in birds exposed to 5 degreesC. Body
   mass, and to a lesser extent fat score, tended to be lowest in birds
   exposed to 5 degreesC compared with those at 20 and 30 degreesC. These
   results demonstrate that ambient temperature significantly affected
   photoperiodically induced gonadal development and regression in these
   birds. The endocrine mechanisms underlying these effects require further
   study. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Science (USA).

AB Food supplementation studies of breeding birds have traditionally
   concentrated on energetic constraints on breeding performance. It is
   only recently that the nutritional quality of the prebreeding diet has
   also been considered influential. We examined the importance of specific
   nutrients in the prebreeding diet of the Florida scrub-jay (Aphelocoma
   coerulescens). Birds were provided with one of two supplements (rich in
   protein and fat or rich in fat only) prior to breeding in 2000 and 2001
   and their breeding performance, in relation to unsupplemented (control)
   birds, was examined. Birds receiving both supplements significantly
   advanced laying in both years, and increased clutch size in 2000 but not
   in 2001. Laying date explained variation in clutch size in birds on
   dietary supplements. Egg mass and volume declined with laying order,
   irrespective of dietary treatment, but birds on the high fat, high
   protein diet laid heavier third eggs than controls and this was
   independent of laying date. Laboratory analysis of 14 abandoned and
   unhatched eggs revealed that as egg mass increased so did the absolute
   amount of protein and water while fat content remained relatively fixed.
   Using these relationships between the masses of egg components and fresh
   egg mass, we calculated that heavier third eggs laid by birds on high
   fat and high protein, compared with those laid by controls, contained
   more water that may be fundamental to chick growth and survival. This is
   the first demonstration for an avian species that nutritional quality of
   prebreeding diet can simultaneously influence laying date, clutch size,
   and egg size and composition.

AB It is well established that vocal mimicry serves an intraspecific
   function in birds by increasing repertoire size. On an interspecific
   level, territorial exclusion of other species by deceptive mimicry may
   occur if the model (i.e., mimicked) species song is effectively
   reproduced by the mimicking species. Few studies have effectively
   demonstrated deceptive mimicry because they did not use the context of
   the mimic's song as a control stimulus. We addressed this shortcoming by
   using isolated and context-dependent playback stimuli to assess the
   response of Florida Scrub-Jay (Aphelocoina coerulescens) pairs to
   Northern Mockingbird (Mimus polyglottos) imitation. Scrubjay pairs
   responded more aggressively to isolated scrub-jay weep calls than to
   playbacks consisting of either isolated imitation calls, imitated calls
   embedded in mockingbird song, or control mockingbird song. These results
   fail to support the hypothesis that mimicry deceives the model species.
   Whether mockingbird imitation of scrub-jays deceives other species
   requires further investigation.

AB We report an observation of egg predation by conspecifics in the Florida
   Scrub-Jay (Aphelocoma coerulescens) at Archbold Biological Station in
   Highlands County, Florida. This is the first confirmed account of
   intraspecific egg predation in this threatened and declining species. We
   observed a group of five jays harass an established breeding pair at
   their nest that contained four warm eggs. One female intruder alighted
   on the nest and carried off an egg in its beak. Other intruding females
   also were seen at the nest and presumably removed two more eggs. The
   following day, the nest was deserted and contained only one cold egg. We
   discuss potential reasons for such conspecific egg predation, focusing
   on resource limitation. We believe that further research in this area is
   essential for this species in which competition for resources (e.g.,
   nesting habitat) intensifies as suitable habitat declines.

AB We examined the demographic consequences of road mortality in the
   cooperatively breeding Florida Scrub-Jay (Aphelocoma coerulescens), a
   threatened species restricted to the oak scrub of peninsular Florida.
   Between May 1986 and July 1995 we monitored the survival and
   reproductive success of a color-banded population of jays along a
   two-lane highway at Archbold Biological Station. Annual mortality of
   breeding adults was 0.38 on road territories, significantly higher than
   the rate of 0.23 for breeders on nonroad territories. High mortality on
   road territories appeared to be a direct result of automobile traffic
   per se and not a consequence of road-induced changes in habitat
   characteristics. Mortality was especially high for immigrants without
   previous experience living along the road: in their first two years as
   breeders on road territories, naive immigrants experienced annual
   mortality of 0.50 and 0.45. From year 3 onward, however, annual
   mortality dropped to 0.29, not significantly different from the rate for
   birds on nonroad territories. This experience-dependent decline in road
   mortality could be caused either by surviving jays learning to avoid
   automobiles or by selective mortality operating through time
   (demographic heterogeneity). Proximity to the road had no effect on
   nesting success beyond its indirect effects on breeder experience and
   group size. Because the mortality of 30- to 90-day-old fledglings was
   significantly higher on road territories than on nonroad territories,
   however, breeder mortality greatly exceeded production of yearlings on
   road territories. Roadside territories therefore are sinks that can
   maintain populations of Florida Scrub-Jays only via immigration. Because
   Florida Scrub-Jays do not avoid roadside habitats and may even be
   attracted to them, road mortality presents a difficult challenge for the
   management and conservation of this threatened and declining species.

AB Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is a potent releaser of prolactin
   (PRL) in domestic fowl, turkey, and ring doves. However, few comparative
   studies have investigated this in wild species. We tested the effects of
   intravenously administered chicken VIP on plasma PRL concentrations in
   four passerine species: the white-crowned sparrow (Zonotrichia
   leucophrys gambelii), the dark-eyed junco (Junco hyemalis), the Florida
   scrub-jay (Aphelocoma coerulescens), and the western scrub-jay (A.
   californica). In the white-crowned sparrow, junco, and Florida
   scrub-jay, which were tested during the breeding season, VIP induced a
   rapid increase in plasma PRL. Serial plasma sampler taken after VIP
   injection in the white-crowned sparrow show a 10-fold increase in PRL
   within 2 min of treatment, followed by a gradual decline. Effects of
   VIP, as compared to saline, remained significant for at least 20 min
   after treatment. Western scrub-jays did not respond to intravenous VIP
   with a significant rise in PRL secretion, possibly because they were
   tested after termination of the breeding season. This study indicates
   that VIP control of PRL release may be widespread among avian species,
   and that seasonal changes in plasma PRL may be mediated in part at the
   level of the pituitary. In addition, analysis of the control data
   revealed no increase in plasma PRL as a result of injection or
   restraint, suggesting that unlike in mammals, PRL is not released during
   acute stress in passerines. (C) 1999 Academic Press.

AB We tested the effects of naturally relevant ambient temperatures (4, 20,
   and 30 degrees C) on photoinduced prolactin (PRL) secretion in three
   subspecies of white-crowned sparrow Zonotrichia leucophrys. In all three
   subspecies, transfer from short to long days triggered an increase in
   plasma PRL typical of an avian seasonal breeder. In z. l. gambelii,
   which breeds at high latitudes, temperature does not affect the rate of
   photoinduced gonadal maturation or luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion.
   In this subspecies, we found that changes in plasma PRL concentrations
   were similar in all temperature treatments. In Z. l. pugetensis, which
   breeds in the Pacific Northwest, high temperatures accelerate gonadal
   development in females but not males and does not affect LH secretion.
   In this subspecies, we found that like gonadal growth, photoinduced
   changes in PRL secretion in z. l. pugetensis vary with ambient
   temperature in females but not males, In Z. l. oriantha, which breeds in
   alpine regions of the West, both males and females respond to
   temperature cues by modulating gonadal growth but not LH secretion. We
   found in Z. l. oriantha that ambient temperature affects PRL secretion
   in both sexes. These results suggest that PRL may be involved in the
   transduction of ambient temperature cues used to time reproductive
   development and the termination of seasonal breeding. Alternatively,
   temperature-mediated differences in plasma PRL may be a result rather
   than a cause of differences in gonadal development, since sex steroids
   affect PRL secretion in some species. (C) 1999 Academic Press.

AB Hormonal manipulations with implants allow examination of the costs and
   benefits of behaviors and physiologic states mediated by a given
   hormone. As a part of ongoing research into the effects of the steroid
   hormone testosterone (T) in Dark-eyed Juncos (Junco hyemalis), we
   measured the corticosterone (B, a steroid hormone secreted by the
   adrenal in response to stress) response to the stress of capture and
   handling in males treated with T (T-males) and in control males
   (C-males). Although B may be essential for energy mobilization, chronic
   or repeated exposure to elevated levels of B can have many negative
   effects. Because T mediates many behaviors that may increase the
   likelihood that an individual will encounter stressors, we predicted
   that plasma B would rise more rapidly in T-males than in controls. In
   the first few minutes post-capture, the increase in B levels was
   significantly higher in T-males than in controls. B levels in samples
   collected 10, 30, and 60 min post-capture were consistently higher in
   T-males than in C-males; however, the difference was not statistically
   significant. Because previous work has shown that T-males reduce their
   parental contribution, we compared females that were mated to T-males
   and C-males (hereafter T- and C-females). B levels of T-females
   increased sharply in the first few minutes post-capture, whereas in
   C-females they did not; however, the responses were not statistically
   different. Males had higher initial levels and a greater B-response to

   Our results suggest that the behaviors or physiological changes induced

AB Numerous studies have shown that parental behaviors are mediated by
   prolactin (PRL), while testosterone (T) interferes with their full
   expression. The limited data available suggest that reduced parental
   behavior induced by T is not mediated by reduced concentrations of
   plasma PRL. We hypothesized that T reduces parental behaviors by
   reducing PRL receptor binding activity at central neural sites that
   promote the expression of parental behaviors. To test this hypothesis we
   implanted male dark-eyed juncos (Junco hyemalis) with
   testosterone-filled or empty implants and measured T and PRL levels,
   paternal behavior, and specific binding of radio-labeled PRL at selected
   brain regions that have been implicated in the mediation of parental
   behaviors. Our findings concurred with previous studies in that
   T-treated males reduced their parental contributions, had higher levels
   of T, and had equivalent levels of PRL compared with controls. We found
   no differences in the capacity to bind I-125-oPRL in three brain regions
   previously implicated in the mediation of parental care in birds, i.e.,
   the preoptic area, ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus, and
   paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus. Thus our findings do not
   support the hypothesis that T interferes with the expression of parental
   behavior by reducing PRL receptor binding activity at central sites. (C)

AB We tested the effects of ambient temperature (5 degrees, 20 degrees, and
   30 degrees) on photoperiodically induced reproductive functions in male
   and female white-crowned sparrows, Zonotrichia leucophrys pugetensis.
   Transfer from short days (9L 15D) to long days (16L 8D) resulted in
   rapid testicular growth and partial ovarian development in all three
   temperature treatments. There were no differences in sizes of testes and
   cloacal protuberance following 30 or 70 days of exposure to long days at
   the different temperatures. However, brood patch and follicular
   development were enhanced in females at 30 degrees compared with the 5
   degrees and 20 degrees groups. Many of these females exposed to 30
   degrees had large yolky follicles by Day 70. This enhancement was
   evident only when females were housed in the same room with males,
   however. Despite the effects of high temperature on ovarian development,
   there were no differences among groups in plasma levels of
   follicle-stimulating hormone or luteinizing hormone, suggesting that
   differential ovarian development may have been mediated by gonadal
   sensitivity to gonadotropins rather than by differential secretion of
   these hormones. We examined circulating levels of corticosterone (B) and
   both tri-iodothyronine (T-3) and thyroxine (T-4) as possible regulators
   of this differential ovarian sensitivity to gonadotropins. Plasma B
   levels showed transitory increases in males at 5 degrees and 20 degrees,
   but were suppressed in males at 30 degrees. Titers of B were not
   influenced by temperature treatments in females. Circulating T-4
   increased following photostimulation in both sexes, but this increase
   was reduced at 5 degrees. T-3 concentrations in plasma were highly
   variable and not influenced by either photoperiod or temperature in
   males, but were significantly lower in females exposed to 30 degrees by
   Day 70. Thus, B and T-4 levels do not appear to help explain
   differential ovarian development, but circulating T-3 levels cannot yet
   be excluded as a regulator of ovarian sensitivity to gonadotropins. Long
   days resulted in no change, or a gradual decrease, in body mass and fat
   deposit in males and females, and temperature regimes had no further
   effects on fattening or body mass. Thus, reproductive development under
   long days appears to be resistant to naturally relevant temperature
   extremes in male Z.l. pugetensis, whereas follicular development (i.e.,
   yolk deposition in follicles leading to ovulation and onset of nesting)
   can be enhanced by high temperature. Reasons for the dimorphism in this
   response are unknown, but may be explained by the role of females in
   determining onset of final ovarian maturation and nesting in relation to
   favorable environmental conditions. In a second experiment, in which the
   sexes were isolated from one another, we determined the effects of the
   same treatments on Z.l. pugetensis. Again there was no effect of
   temperature on photoperiodically induced testicular growth, and the
   enhancement of follicular development in females at 30 degrees was
   greatly reduced in the absence of males. We also continued this
   experiment up to 116 days of treatment to investigate effects on onset
   of photorefractoriness (spontaneous gonadal regression) and onset of
   prebasic moult. In both sexes it was clear that low temperature (5
   degrees) retarded gonadal regression and high temperature (30 degrees)
   advanced it. Similarly, the prebasic moult score was greater at 30
   degrees and less at 5 degrees in both sexes.
   There were no effects of temperature on plasma levels of LH at Day 116
   of treatment, but plasma levels of T-4 were higher in the 5 degrees
   group of both males and females sampled at Day 116. Clearly, the effects
   of temperature can have different effects on gonadal recrudescence,
   onset of breeding (yolk deposition), and termination of breeding.
   Whether these influences of temperature on reproductive function at
   different stages in the breeding cycle have different mechanisms remains
   to be determined. (C) 1997 Academic Press.

AB In the cooperatively breeding Florida scrub-jay, nonbreeders are
   subordinate to the breeders with which they share a territory.
   Corticosterone is secreted in response to a wide range of stressors,
   including social stress, and suppresses reproductive and territorial
   behaviors in several taxa; thus, elevated baseline levels of
   corticosterone might be a causal mechanism of reproductive suppression.
   To test the hypothesis that nonbreeder Florida scrub-jays are
   reproductively suppressed through the actions of corticosterone, we
   compared corticosterone levels of nonbreeders and breeders and found no
   differences. However, baseline corticosterone levels only provide
   information about a bird's current hormonal status. Virtually all
   species exhibit a rapid rise in glucocorticoids in response to an acute
   stressor. If the adrenocortical response of nonbreeders is greater than
   that of breeders, this might be a mechanism whereby nonbreeders remain
   reproductively quiescent. We compared the responses of breeders and
   nonbreeders to the acute stress of being captured and held for 1 h. Both
   exhibited significant but equivalent increases in corticosterone titers.
   Because in some species heavier or fatter individuals have reduced
   glucocorticoid responses to stressors, we examined whether body mass was
   correlated with corticosterone titers. Both baseline and maximum
   corticosterone levels covaried with body mass, and the effect of body
   mass on corticosterone levels explained the increase due to capture and
   handling. Our data do not support the hypothesis that Florida scrub-jay
   nonbreeders are reproductively suppressed through the actions of
   corticosterone.

AB The relationship between parental and alloparental behaviours and
   prolactin was examined by measuring plasma levels of prolactin in
   cooperatively breeding Florida scrub-jays during three breeding seasons.
   The seasonal trends were similar to those in several other avian
   species, with low prolactin titres during the pre-nesting phase that
   steadily increased to a maximum during the incubation and nestling
   periods. Females had higher prolactin levels than males, and breeders
   had higher levels than non-breeders. Circulating prolactin in
   non-breeders was elevated prior to the time when they were exposed to a
   nest or young, suggesting that high prolactin levels were not a simple
   response to the stimulus of begging young. To further assess
   correlations between prolactin and parent-like behaviours, the number of
   nest visits and the amount of food delivered to focal nests was
   monitored. Prolactin levels were significantly correlated with the
   number of visits to the nest, as well as the amount of food delivered to
   the young. Non-breeders that fed nestlings had higher prolactin titres
   than non-breeders that did not help, lending further support to the
   hypothesis that helping behaviours are mediated by prolactin. (C) 1996

AB To determine whether fundamental differences exist in the reproductive
   physiology of breeder and nonbreeder Florida scrub-jays (Aphelocoma
   coerulescens), we compared plasma levels of testosterone (T) and
   luteinizing hormone (LH) in males, and estradiol (E(2)) and LH in
   females. Although male breeders had higher overall T and larger testes,
   nonbreeders' T paralleled that of breeders, and their testes were more
   than an order of magnitude larger than regressed testes. Breeder and
   nonbreeder males had equivalent baseline LH, and equivalent changes in
   LH following a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (cGnRH-I) challenge. The T
   LH and GnRH challenge data indicate that nonbreeder males have
   functional hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axes. We found no
   hormonal evidence of inbreeding suppression in males: nonbreeders that
   did not live with their mothers and those that did had similar T Male
   nonbreeders that were exposed to E(2)-implanted females had higher T
   than did controls, suggesting that the lack of within-pair stimulation
   is a key factor in whether an individual delays breeding. Female
   nonbreeders had E(2) titres equal to or higher than breeders and neither
   basal LH nor LH following GnRH challenge differed by breeding status.
   Nonbreeders' ovarian follicles were smaller than breeders', but were
   larger than they would be during the nonbreeding season. These data
   suggest that nonbreeders were primed for breeding and were simply
   waiting for an opportunity or a required stimulus. Female nonbreeders
   that lived in a territory with an unrelated male breeder had
   significantly higher E(2) than those that remained with their fathers.
   Similarly, nonbreeders that were captured away from their home
   territories had elevated E(2). However, nonbreeders that lived with
   their fathers had E(2) that was equivalent to breeding females,
   suggesting that inbreeding avoidance may not be the primary factor
   leading to delayed breeding in females.

AB I examined the importance of food availability on when or whether to
   breed in cooperatively breeding Florida Scrub-Jays (Aphelocoma
   coerulescens). Two of the major factors known to influence the timing of
   reproduction are adequate food for offspring and sufficient available
   food for breeding females to produce a clutch. If the nutritive needs of
   a breeding female affect the timing of clutch initiation, food
   supplemented females should lay before controls. Supplemented female
   breeders initiated clutches earlier and produced larger clutches than
   unsupplemented birds. If food abundance declines as the breeding season
   progresses to the point where fewer young can be fed, clutch size should
   also decline. Florida Scrub-Jay females laid smaller clutches as the
   season progressed. Additionally, female breeders given supplemental food
   had higher levels of body lipids than controls prior to clutch
   initiation.
   The food supplementation protocol also allows the testing of the
   hypothesis that nonbreeder Florida Scrub-Jays forgo breeding because
   they are food limited. If food limitation were the only factor in the
   'decision' by nonbreeders to forgo breeding, individuals provided with
   food would become breeders at a higher frequency than unsupplemented
   birds. However, equal frequencies of control and supplemented
   nonbreeders became breeders. I also compared body mass and body lipid of
   breeders and nonbreeders and found that breeders were heavier and had
   higher percentages of body lipids than nonbreeders. However, these
   differences probably do not cause them to be nonbreeders but rather are
   a result of their being nonbreeders.
