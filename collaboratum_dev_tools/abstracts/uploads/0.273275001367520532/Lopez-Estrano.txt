AB Identification of promoter elements responsible for regulation of gene
   expression has been hampered by the AT richness of P. falciparum
   intergenic regions. Nested deletions of histidine-rich protein 3 (hrp3)
   promoter suggested the presence of a multipartite ring-specific element.
   Linker scanning (LS) of this ring-specific promoter showed that the
   alteration of several promoter regions decreased the luciferase activity
   compared to the wild-type configuration, indicating that these regions
   played a role in gene expression. No homology was observed by comparison
   of putative regulatory elements of other genes identified by
   bioinformatic analysis with the hrp3 enhancer, implying a different
   mechanism of gene regulation by the hrp3 promoter. LS and deletion
   analysis of the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of the hrp3 suggested that
   this region contains elements which interact with promoter elements to
   regulate gene expression. Analysis of the intron in the UTR region
   suggested that this region does not play a role in stage specificity in
   the hrp3 promoter. Together, our results indicate the presence of
   multiple mechanisms of gene regulation in the parasite.

AB Over 80% of Plasmodium falciparum genes are developmentally regulated
   during the parasite's life cycle with most genes expressed in a "just in
   time" fashion. However, the molecular mechanisms of gene regulation are
   still poorly understood. Analysis of A falciparum genome shows that the
   parasite appears to encode relatively few transcription factors
   homologous to those in other eukaryotes. We used Chromatin
   immunoprecipitation (Chip) to study interaction of PfTBP and PfTFIIE
   with stage specific Plasmodium promoters. Our results indicate that
   PftBP and PfTFIIE are bound to their cognate sequence in active and
   inactive erythrocytic-expressed promoters. In addition, TF occupancy
   appears to extend beyond the promoter regions, since PfTBP interaction
   with the coding and 3' end regions was also detected. No PfTBP or
   PfTFIIE interaction was detected on csp and pfs25 genes which are not
   active during the erythrocytic asexual stage. Furthermore. PfTBP and
   PfTFIIE binding did not appear to correlate with histone 3 and/or 4
   acetylation, suggesting that histone acetylation may not be a
   prerequisite for PfTBP or PfTFIIE promoter interaction. Based on our
   observations we concluded that the PfTBP/PfTFIIE-containing
   preinitiation complex (PIC) would be preassembled on promoters of all
   erythrocytic-expressed genes in a fashion independent of histone
   acetylation, providing support for the "poised" model. Contrary to the
   classical model of eukaryotic gene regulation, PIC interaction with
   Plasmodium promoters occurred independent of transcriptional activity
   and to the notion that chromatin acetylation leads to PIC assembly. (C)

AB Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an important opportunistic pathogen of the
   human urinary bladder. Similar to rat liver S9, the cell-free extract
   from P. aeruginosa caused significant increase of histidine reversion
   numbers with the Salmonella typhimurium tester strain TA98 in the Ames
   Salmonella mutagenicity assay in the presence of either 2-aminofluorene,
   4-aminobiphenyl, or benzidine procarcinogens. The presence of cytochrome
   P-450 protein in the cell-free extract was demonstrated by the carbon
   monoxide difference spectrum. We employed gene knockout technology to
   inactivate one of the three known putative cytochrome P-450 genes of P.
   aeruginosa, namely CYP107S1, which we postulated to be the most likely
   to induce activation. The ampicillin resistant gene from PUC19 DNA
   confers carbenicillin resistance to P. aeruginosa. We inserted a
   synthetic ampicillin gene flanked by 40 base-pairs of the 5' and 3'
   untranslated region of the CYP gene by electroporating the synthetic
   gene into electrocompetent P. aeruginosa cells. CYPI07S1 knockout
   strains were selected on 1000 mu g/ml carbenicillin plates. A single
   cloned carbenicillin resistant colony was isolated and used to determine
   its mutagenic capacity using Ames Salmonella mutagenicity assay. The
   results showed that Salmonella TA98 tester strain returned the number of
   revertants to its baselines level indicating the lack of metabolic
   activation of procarcinogens in the P. aeruginosa CYPI07S1 knockout
   cell-free extract. In addition, the characteristic cytochrome P-450 peak
   determined by the carbon monoxide difference spectrum was completely
   absent in the cell-free extract from this CYPI07S1 knockout strain
   bacterium. Homologous recombination of the synthetic ampicillin gene on
   the CYP 107S1 P-450 locus was confirmed by PCR on purified genomic DNA
   extracted from the knockout bacterium. The metabolic activation of
   tested procarcinogens is, therefore, carried out by CYPI07S1 in P.
   aeruginosa. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The asexual blood stage of Plasmodium falciparum is comprised of
   morphologically distinct ring, trophozoite and schizont stages. Each of
   these developmental stages possesses a distinct pattern of gene
   expression. Regulation of R falciparum gene expression is thought to
   occur, at least in part, at the promoter level. Previously, we have
   found that although the hrp3 mRNA is only seen in ring-stage parasites,
   deletion of a specific sequence in the 5' end of the promoter region
   decreased ring-stage expression of hrp3 and enabled detection of its
   transcripts in trophozoite-stage parasites. In order to investigate this
   stage specific regulation of gene expression, we employed a series of
   nested deletions of the 1.7-kb hrp3 promoter. Firefly luciferase gene
   was used as a reporter to evaluate the role of promoter sequences in
   gene regulation. Using this approach, we identified a ring-stage
   specific regulatory region on the hrp3 promoter located between - 1.7 kb
   and - 1.1 kb from the ATG initiation codon. Small 100-150 bp truncations
   on this enhancer-like region failed to uncover discrete regulatory
   sequences, suggesting the multipartite nature of this element. The data
   presented in this study demonstrate that stage specific promoter
   activity of the hrp3 gene in P. falciparum blood stage parasites is
   supported, at least in-part, by a small promoter region that can
   function in the absence of a larger chromosomal context. (c) 2007

AB The asexual blood stage of Plasmodium falciparum in the human host is
   comprised of morphologically distinct ring, trophozoite and schizont
   stages, each of which possesses a distinct pattern of gene expression.
   Episomal promoter recombination has been recently reported in malaria
   parasites. We aim to investigate the nature of this process, and its
   relationship with promoter activity by employing a series of nested
   deletions of the ring-specific hrp3 promoter. Our results showed a
   discrete promoter region that is preferentially used for recombination.
   The P. falciparum hrp3 mRNA is only seen in ring-stage parasites but
   deletion of the recombination region was associated with decreased
   ring-stage expression and concurrent detection of transcripts in
   trophozoite-stage parasites. Our results describe a ring-stage specific
   regulatory region possibly involved in episomal promoter recombination,
   suggesting that common sequences might mediate both processes. (c) 2007

AB Polar replication fork barriers (RFBs) near the 3' end of the rRNA
   transcriptional unit are a conserved feature of ribosomal DNA (rDNA)
   replication in eukaryotes. In the mouse, in vivo studies indicate that
   the cis-acting Sal boxes required for rRNA transcription termination are
   also involved in replication fork blockage. On the contrary, in the
   budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the rRNA transcription
   termination factors are not required for RFBs. Here we characterized the
   rDNA RFBs in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. S. pombe rDNA
   contains three closely spaced polar replication barriers named RFB1,
   RFB2, and RFB3 in the 3' to 5' order. The transcription termination
   protein reb1 and its two binding sites, present at the 3' end of the
   coding region, were required for fork arrest at RFB2 and RFB3 in vivo.
   On the other hand, fork arrest at the strongest RFB1 barrier was
   independent of the above transcription termination factors. Therefore,
   RFB2 and RFB3 resemble the barriers present in the mouse rDNA, whereas
   RFB1 is similar to the budding yeast RFBs. These results suggest that
   during evolution, cis- and trans-acting factors required for rRNA
   transcription termination became involved in replication fork blockage
   also. S. pombe is suggested to be a transitional species in which both
   mechanisms coexist.

AB When the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum infects an erythrocyte,
   it resides in a parasitophorous vacuole and remarkably exports proteins
   into the periphery of its host cell. Two of these proteins, the
   histidine-rich proteins I and II (PfHRPI and PfHRPII), are exported to
   the erythrocyte cytoplasm. PfHRPI has been linked to cell-surface
   "knobby" protrusions that mediate cerebral malaria and are a frequent
   cause of death. PfHRPII has been implicated in (i) the production of
   hemozoin, the black pigment associated with disease, as well as (ii)
   interactions with the erythrocyte cytoskeleton. Here we show that a
   tripartite signal that is comprised of an endoplasmic reticulum-type
   signal sequence followed by a bipartite vacuolar translocation signal
   derived from HRPII and HRIPI exports GFP from the parasitophorous
   vacuole to the host cytoplasm. The bipartite vacuolar translocation
   signal is comprised of unique, peptidic (approximate to40-aa) sequences.
   A domain within it contains the signal for export to "cleft" transport
   intermediates in the host erythrocyte and may thereby regulate the
   pathway of export to the host cytoplasm. A signal for posttranslational,
   vacuolar exit of proteins has hitherto not been described in eukaryotic
   secretion.

AB We analyzed three chromosomal loci of the trypanosomatid Leptomonas
   collosoma encoding box C/D small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs). All the
   snoRNAs that were analyzed here carry two sequences complementary to
   rRNA target sites and obey the +5 rule for guide methylation. Studies on
   transgenic parasites carrying the snoRNA-2 gene in the episomal
   expression vector (pX-neo) indicated that no promoter activity was found
   immediately adjacent to this gene. Deleting the flanking sequences of
   snoRNA-2 affected the expression; in the absence of the 3'-flanking (but
   not 5'-flanking) sequence, the expression was almost completely
   abolished. The snoRNA genes are transcribed as polycistronic RNA. All
   snoRNAs can be folded into a common stem-loop structure, which may play
   a role in processing the polycistronic transcript. snoRNA B2, a member
   of a snoRNA cluster, was expressed when cloned into the episomal vector,
   suggesting that each gene within a cluster is individually processed.
   Studies with permeable cells indicated that snoRNA gene transcription
   was relatively sensitive to alpha -amanitin, thus supporting
   transcription by RNA polymerase II. We propose that snoRNA gene
   expression, similar to protein-coding genes in this family, is regulated
   at the processing level.

AB It was previously shown that in pea (Pisum sativum), rDNA repeats
   contain a polar replication fork barrier that blocks progression of the
   replication machinery moving in the direction opposite to transcription.
   This barrier maps in the untranscribed spacer close to the 3' end of the
   25S gene. Very similar barriers are also found in the rDNA of yeast,
   Xenopus and mammalian cultured cells. This high conservation indicates
   that the rDNA barrier plays a relevant biological role. Progression of
   replication forks through the DNA sequence where the barrier maps in pea
   was investigated in plasmids replicating in Escherichia coli and
   Saccharomyces cerevisiae. No barrier was detected in these heterologous
   systems, indicating that the DNA sequence by itself was insufficient to
   block the replication machinery. Therefore, trans-acting factors were
   likely to be required. Taking advantage of the natural sequence
   heterogeneity in pea rDNA, we obtained evidence that a 27 bp imperfect
   tandem repeat is involved in the arrest of replication. Moreover,
   nuclear protein(s) specifically bound to this repeat suggesting that
   this DNA/protein complex is responsible for the polar arrest of
   replication forks.

AB Previous studies have identified a conserved AG dinucleotide at the 3'
   splice site (3'SS) and a polypyrimidine (pPy) tract that are required
   for trans splicing of polycistronic pre-mRNAs in trypanosomatids.
   Furthermore, the pPy tract of the Trypanosoma brucei alpha-tubulin 3'SS
   region is required to specify accurate 3'-end formation of the upstream
   beta-tubulin gene and trans splicing of the downstream alpha-tubulin
   gene. Here, we employed an in vivo cis competition assay to determine
   whether sequences other than those of the AG dinucleotide and the pPy
   tract were required for 3'SS identification. Our results indicate that a
   minimal alpha-tubulin 3'SS, from the putative branch site region to the
   AG dinucleotide, is not sufficient for recognition by the trans-splicing
   machinery and that polyadenylation is strictly dependent on downstream
   trans splicing. We show that efficient use of the alpha-tubulin 3'SS is
   dependent upon the presence of exon sequences. Furthermore,
   beta-tubulin, but not actin er;on sequences or unrelated plasmid
   sequences, can replace alpha-tubulin exon sequences for accurate
   trans-splice-site selection. Taken together, these results support a
   model in which the informational content required for efficient trans
   splicing of the alpha-tubulin pre-mRNA includes exon sequences which are
   involved in modulation of trans-splicing efficiency. Sequences that
   positively regulate trails splicing might be similar to cis-splicing
   enhancers described in other systems.

AB The plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase from human erythrocytes can be
   stimulated by different treatments such as addition of calmodulin or
   acidic phospholipids and controlled proteolysis. In this report we show
   that short chain alkyl alcohols also stimulated this enzyme. At 5% (v/v)
   ethanol, the maximal velocity of the enzyme was about 2.4-fold higher
   than in the control, and thus, was also higher than the maximal velocity
   obtained in the presence of calmodulin (about 2-fold). When ethanol and
   calmodulin were present simultaneously, the stimulatory effect was
   additive (3.4-fold stimulation). On the other hand, the stimulatory
   effect of ethanol was preserved after treatment of the enzyme with
   trypsin to stimulate the Ca2+-ATPase and render it independent of
   calmodulin, thus suggesting that the interaction of ethanol and
   calmodulin with the Ca2+-ATPase occurred through a different mechanism.
   Other short chain alkyl alcohols (methanol, n-propanol and n-butanol)
   stimulated the Ca2+-ATPase activity to the same extent than ethanol but
   with different efficacy. Thus, the larger the carbon number, the lower
   the concentration needed to get the same maximal stimulation. Ethanol
   also increased the affinity of the enzyme for ATP to a larger extent and
   additively, when compared to calmodulin. All the effects of ethanol
   mentioned above were identically observed on the membrane-bound enzyme
   (i.e., erythrocyte ghosts) ruling out any effect of the alcohols
   attributable to the solubilized purified enzyme. Furthermore, Ca2+
   transport by inside-out vesicles was also stimulated by ethanol, showing
   both the same concentration-dependence as the Ca2+-ATPase activity and
   the additive effect observed when calmodulin was also present. The
   stimulatory effect of ethanol was significant at pharmacological
   concentrations, thus suggesting potential implications of toxicological
   relevance.

   trypanosomatids only contains Ca2+-ATPase that does not show any
   demonstrable dependence on Mg2+, a high-affinity (Ca2+-Mg2+)-ATPase was
   demonstrated in the plasma membrane of Trypanosoma brucei. The enzyme
   became saturated with micromolar amounts of Ca2+, reaching a V(max) of
   3.45 +/- 0.66 nmol of ATP/min per mg of protein. The K(m,app.) for Ca2+
   was 0.52 +/- 0.03 muM. This was decreased to 0.23 +/- 0.05 muM, and the
   V(max.) was increased to 6.36 +/- 0.22 nmol of ATP/min per mg of protein
   (about 85 %), when calmodulin was present. T. brucei plasma-membrane
   vesicles accumulated Ca2+ on addition of ATP only when Mg2+ was present,
   and released it on addition of the Ca2+ ionophore A23187. In addition,
   this Ca2+ transport was stimulated by calmodulin. Addition of NaCl to
   Ca2+-loaded T. brucei plasma-membrane vesicles did not result in Ca2+
   release, thus suggesting the absence of a Na+/Ca2+ exchanger in these
   parasites. Therefore the (Ca2+-Mg2+)-ATPase would be the only mechanism
   so far described that is responsible for the long-term fine tuning of

   trypanocidal drug pentamidine inhibited the T. brucei plasma-membrane
   (Ca2+-Mg2+)-ATPase and Ca2+ transport at concentrations that had no
   effect on the Ca2+-ATPase activity of human or pig erythrocytes. In this
   latter case, pentamidine behaved as a weak calmodulin antagonist, since
   it inhibited the stimulation of the erythrocyte Ca2+-ATPase by
   calmodulin.
